        <h1>How We Teach</h1>
        <div>
          <p>E-doing is a design philosophy that applies the principle that people learn best by doing. The curriculum includes embedded, highly interactive e-doing activities to help stimulate learning, increase knowledge retention, and make the whole learning experience much richer – and that makes understanding the content much easier.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Interactive Activities</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Interactive activities are embedded within the chapters as checks for understanding. Some of these use “drag and drop” to complete the activity (Figure 1). Others use a “checkbox” method to complete them (Figure 2). You can check your score immediately. You can also reset and do the activity as many times as you like.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Labs</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Labs are activities that are designed to be performed on physical equipment (Figure 3). Some labs are written as class or small group activities that may or may not involve equipment. It is very important to learn and practice physical skills by using the labs in this course in preparation for a career in IT. Working on physical equipment not only develops skills, but also reinforces knowledge and builds confidence. This is very important as you move into the IT field.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Packet Tracer</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>In the Networking chapters, you will configure a simple network using Packet Tracer, the Networking Academy network simulation tool (Figure 4). Click <a href="https://www.netacad.com/group/offerings/packet-tracer" target="_blank">here</a> to download the latest version of Packet Tracer. Packet Tracer may look complicated at first glance, but is easy to work with, and there are many tutorials to help you learn how to use it. Packet Tracer is a very robust tool that you will use regularly as you participate in more advanced networking courses.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Cisco Aspire</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Cisco Aspire is a single-player, standalone strategic simulation game (Figure 5). The Networking Academy Edition incorporates business and communication skills IT employers seek in job candidates. Click <a href="https://www.netacad.com/group/offerings/cisco-aspire" target="_blank">here</a> to learn more about Cisco Aspire Networking Academy Edition.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Assessments</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Each chapter in the course has an online quiz and online chapter exam (Figure 6). These are scored automatically, showing you the areas where you excel, as well as any areas where you may want to do some additional study or practice. There is an online, end-of-course final exam, and a performance-based skills assessment which you will do in class.</p>
