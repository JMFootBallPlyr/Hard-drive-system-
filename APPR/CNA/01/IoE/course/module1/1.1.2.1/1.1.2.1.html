        <h1>Motherboards</h1>
        <div>
          <p>The motherboard, also known as the system board or the main board, is the backbone of the computer. As shown in Figure 1, a motherboard is a printed circuit board (PCB) that contains buses, or electrical pathways, that interconnect electronic components. These components may be soldered directly to the motherboard, or added using sockets, expansion slots, and ports. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>These are some connections on the motherboard where computer components can be added, as shown in Figure 2:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Central Processing Unit (CPU)</b> - This is considered the brain of the computer.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Random Access Memory (RAM)</b> - This is a temporary location to store data and applications.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Expansion slots</b> - These provide locations to connect additional components.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Chipset</b> - This consists of the integrated circuits on the motherboard that control how system hardware interacts with the CPU and motherboard. It also establishes how much memory can be added to a motherboard and the type of connectors on the motherboard.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Basic input/output system (BIOS)</b> chip and <b>Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI)</b> chip - BIOS is used to help boot the computer and manage the flow of data between the hard drive, video card, keyboard, mouse, and more. Recently the BIOS has been enhanced by UEFI. UEFI specifies a different software interface for boot and runtime services but still relies on the traditional BIOS for system configuration, power-on self test (POST), and setup.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>Figure 3 displays a motherboard with some additional components installed.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Most chipsets consist of the following two types:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Northbridge</b> – Controls high speed access to the RAM and video card. It also controls the speed at which the CPU communicates with all of the other components in the computer. Video capability is sometimes integrated into the Northbridge.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Southbridge</b> – Allows the CPU to communicate with slower speed devices including hard drives, Universal Serial Bus (USB) ports, and expansion slots. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>Figure 4 illustrates how a motherboard connects various components.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The form factor of motherboards pertains to the size and shape of the board. It also describes the physical layout of the different components and devices on the motherboard. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>There have been many variations of motherboards developed over the years. There are three common motherboard form factors: </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Advanced Technology eXtended (ATX)</b> - This is the most common motherboard form factor. The ATX case accommodates the integrated I/O ports on the standard ATX motherboard. The ATX power supply connects to the motherboard via a single 20-pin connector.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Micro-ATX</b> – This is a smaller form factor that is designed to be backward-compatible with ATX. Micro-ATX boards often use the same Northbridge and Southbridge chipsets and power connectors as full-size ATX boards and therefore can use many of the same components. Generally, Micro-ATX boards can fit in standard ATX cases. However, Micro-ATX motherboards are much smaller than ATX motherboards and have fewer expansion slots.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>ITX</b> - The ITX form factor has gained in popularity because of its very small size. There are many types of ITX motherboards; however, Mini-ITX is one of the most popular. The Mini-ITX form factor uses very little power, so fans are not needed to keep it cool. A Mini-ITX motherboard has only one PCI slot for expansion cards. A computer based on a Mini-ITX form factor can be used in places where it is inconvenient to have a large or noisy computer.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>The table in Figure 5 highlights these and other form factor variations.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Note</b>: It is important to distinguish between form factors. The choice of motherboard form factor determines how individual components attach to it, the type of power supply required, and the shape of the computer case. Some manufacturers also have proprietary form factors based on the ATX design. This causes some motherboards, power supplies, and other components to be incompatible with standard ATX cases.</p>
