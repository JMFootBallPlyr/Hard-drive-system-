        <h1>Storage Device Interfaces and RAID</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Internal HDDs, SSDs, and optical drives often connect to the motherboard using Serial AT Attachment (SATA) connections. SATA drives connect to the motherboard using a SATA 7-pin data connector. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>At one end of the cable, the connector is keyed for the drive and the opposite end is keyed for the drive controller.  Figure 1 shows a SATA cable. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Note</b>: Legacy internal drive connection methods include Integrated Drive Electronics (IDE), Enhanced Integrated Drive Electronics (EIDE), and Parallel ATA.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Storage devices can also connect externally to the computer. Figure 2 shows a portable hard disk drive connected to a laptop using a USB cable. USB has become the most common way to connect external devices. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>USB 3.0 and USB 3.1 are blue in color and have become popular for connecting external storage devices because of fast transmission rates. USB drives are also hot-swappable, which means that there is no need to reboot a computer when adding or removing a drive. A single USB port in a computer can theoretically support up to 127 separate devices with the use of USB hubs. A USB hub connects multiple USB devices. Finally, many devices can be powered through the USB port, eliminating the need for an external power source.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>There are several types of USB connectors. Figure 3 displays the most common end, USB Type A. It also displays three other common USB connectors. Figure 4 displays the USB-C (or USB Type C) which is the newest USB connector.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Methods of connecting external storage devices are described in the table in Figure 5. Figure 6 displays a bandwidth comparison between these methods.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Storage devices can also be grouped and managed to create large storage spaces with redundancy. To do so, computers can implement a redundant array of independent disks (RAID) technology. RAID provides a way to store data across multiple hard disks for redundancy and/or performance improvement. To the operating system, a RAID array appears as one disk. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The following terms describe how RAID stores data on the various disks:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Parity </b>- Detects data errors.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Striping</b> - Writes data across multiple drives.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Mirroring</b> - Stores duplicate data on a second drive.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>There are several levels of RAID available. Figure 7 compares these different RAID levels.</p>
