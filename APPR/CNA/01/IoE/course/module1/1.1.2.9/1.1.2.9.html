        <h1>Storage Devices</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Storage drives, as shown in Figure 1, read information from or write information to magnetic, optical, or semiconductor storage media. The drive can be used to store data permanently or to retrieve information from a media disk. </p>
          <p>The following are common types of storage drives:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Hard Disk Drive (HDD)</b> - HDDs are the traditional magnetic disk devices that have been used for years. Their storage capacity ranges from gigabytes (GBs) to terabytes (TBs). Their speed is measured in revolutions per minute (RPM). This indicates how fast the spindle turns the platters that hold data. The faster the spindle speed, the faster a hard drive can find data on the platters. Common hard drive spindle speeds include 5400, 7200, and 10,000 RPM. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Solid State Drive (SSD)</b> - SSDs use nonvolatile flash memory chips to store data. This means that they are faster than magnetic HDDs. Their storage capacity also ranges from GBs to TBs. SSDs have no moving parts and therefore make no noise, are more energy efficient, and produce less heat than HDDs. SSDs have the same form factor as HDDs and are increasingly being used in place of magnetic HDDs.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Hybrid Drive </b>â€“ Also called a Solid State Hybrid Drive (SSHD), these are a compromise between a magnetic HDD and an SSD. They are faster than an HDD but less expensive than an SSD. They are a magnetic HDD with an onboard SSD serving as cache. The SSHD drive automatically caches data that is frequently accessed.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Optical Drive</b> - An optical drive uses lasers to read data on optical media. There are three types of optical drives including compact disc (CD), digital versatile disc (DVD), and Blu-ray disc (BD). CD, DVD, and BD media can be pre-recorded (read only), recordable (write once), or rewriteable (read and write multiple times). Figure 2 describes the various types of optical media and their approximate storage capacity.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Tape Drive</b> - Magnetic tapes are most often used for archiving data. The tape drive uses a magnetic read/write head. Although data retrieval using a tape drive can be fast, locating specific data is slow because the tape must be wound on a reel until the data is found. Common tape storage capacities vary between a few GBs to TBs.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>External Flash Drive</b> - An external flash drive, such as a USB thumb drive that connects to a USB port. An external flash drive uses the same type of nonvolatile memory chips as SSDs. It does not require power to maintain its data. Their storage capacity ranges from MBs to GBs.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Note</b>: Older computers may still incorporate legacy storage devices including floppy disk drives.</p>
