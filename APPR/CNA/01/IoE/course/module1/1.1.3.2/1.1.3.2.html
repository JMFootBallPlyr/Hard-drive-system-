        <h1>Other Ports and Cables</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Input/output (I/O) ports on a computer connect peripheral devices, such as printers, scanners, and portable drives. In addition to the ports and interfaces previously discussed, a computer may also have other ports:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>PS/2 Ports</b> – (Figure 1) A PS/2 port connects a keyboard or a mouse to a computer. The PS/2 port is a 6-pin mini-DIN female connector. The connectors for the keyboard and mouse are often colored differently. If the ports are not color-coded, look for a small figure of a mouse or keyboard next to each port.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Audio Ports</b> – (Figure 2) Audio ports connect audio devices to the computer. Typically includes a line in port to connect to an external source (e.g., stereo system), a microphone port, and a line out port to connect speakers or headphones. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Game port/MIDI </b>– (Figure 2) Connects to a joystick or MIDI-interfaced device.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Ethernet Network port</b> – (Figure 3) A network port, this used to be known as an RJ-45 port. An Ethernet network port has 8 pins and connects devices to a network. The connection speed depends on the type of network port. There a two common Ethernet standards being used. Specifically, Fast Ethernet (or 100BASE) can transmit up to 100 Mb/s, and Gigabit Ethernet (1000BASE) can transmit up to 1000 Mb/s. The maximum length of the Ethernet network cable is 100 m (328 ft.). </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>USB Ports and Cables</b> - The Universal Serial Bus (USB) is a standard interface that connects peripheral devices to a computer. USB devices are hot-swappable, which means that users can connect and disconnect the devices while the computer is powered on. USB connections can be found on computers, cameras, printers, scanners, storage devices, and many other electronic devices. A USB hub connects multiple USB devices. A single USB port in a computer can support up to 127 separate devices with the use of multiple USB hubs. Some devices can also be powered through the USB port, eliminating the need for an external power source. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>USB 1.1 allowed transmission rates of up to 12 Mb/s in full-speed mode and 1.5 Mb/s in low-speed mode. A USB 1.1 cable has a maximum length of 9.8 ft (3 m). USB 2.0 allows transmission speeds up to 480 Mb/s. A USB 2.0 cable has a maximum length of 16.4 ft (5 m). USB devices can only transfer data up to the maximum speed allowed by the specific port. USB 3.0 allows transmission speeds up to 5 Gb/s. USB 3.0 is backward-compatible with previous versions of USB. A USB 3.0 cable does not have a maximum defined length, although a maximum length of 9.8 ft (3 m) is generally accepted.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>FireWire Ports and Cables</b> - FireWire is a high-speed, hot-swappable interface that connects peripheral devices to a computer. A single FireWire port in a computer can support up to 63 devices. Some devices can also be powered through the FireWire port, eliminating the need for an external power source. FireWire uses the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 1394 standard and is also known as i.Link. The IEEE creates publications and standards for technology. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>The IEEE 1394a standard supports data rates up to 400 Mb/s for cable lengths of 15 ft (4.5 m) or less. This standard uses a 4-pin or 6-pin connector. The IEEE 1394b (Firewire 800) standard allows for a greater range of connections, including CAT5 UTP and optical fiber. Depending on the media used, data rates are supported up to 3.2 Gb/s for distances of 328 ft (100 m) or less. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>eSATA Data Cables</b> - The external SATA (eSATA) cable connects SATA devices to the eSATA interface using a 7-pin data cable. This cable does not supply any power to the SATA device. A separate power cable provides power to the disk. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Note</b>: Other ports include serial ports, parallel ports, and modem ports.</p>
