        <h1>Virtualization Workstations</h1>
        <div>
          <p>You may need to build a computer for a customer who uses virtualization technologies. Simultaneously running two or more operating systems on one computer is called <i>virtualization</i>. Often, an operating system is installed, and virtualization software is used to install and manage additional installations of other operating systems. Different operating systems from multiple software companies may be used.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>There is another type of virtualization called Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI).  VDI allows users to log in to a server to access virtual computers. Input from the mouse and keyboard is sent to the server to manipulate the virtual computer. Output such as sound and video is sent back to the speakers and display of the client accessing the virtual computer. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Low-powered thin clients use a server that is much more powerful to perform difficult calculations. Laptops, smart phones, and tablets can also access the VDI to use virtual computers. These are some other functions of virtual computing:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Test software or software upgrades in an environment that does not hurt your current operating system environment.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Use more than one type of operating system on one computer, such as Linux or Mac OS X.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Browse the Internet without harmful software hurting your main installation.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Run old applications that are not compatible with modern operating systems.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>Virtual computing requires more powerful hardware configurations because each installation needs its own resources. One or two virtual environments can be run on a modern computer with modest hardware, but a complete VDI installation may require fast, expensive hardware to support multiple users in many different environments. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>This is some of the hardware required to run virtual computers:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Maximum RAM</b> - You need enough RAM to meet the requirements of each virtual environment and the host computer. A standard installation using only a few virtual machines might require as little as 1 GB of RAM to support a modern operating system such as Windows 8. With multiple users, supporting many virtual computers for each user, you might need to install 64 GB of RAM or more. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>CPU cores</b> - Although a single core CPU can perform virtual computing, a CPU with additional cores increases speed and responsiveness when hosting multiple users and virtual machines. Some VDI installations use computers that have many CPUs with multiple cores.</li>
            </ul>
