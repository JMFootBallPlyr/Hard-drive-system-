        <h1>Application and Content Sources</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Apps are the programs that are executed on mobile devices. Mobile devices come with a number of different apps preinstalled to provide basic functionality. There are apps to make phone calls, send and receive email, listen to music, take pictures, and play video or video games. Many other types of apps enable information retrieval, device customization, and productivity.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Apps are used on mobile devices the same way that programs are used on computers. Instead of being installed from an optical disk, apps are downloaded from a content source. Some apps can be downloaded for free, and others must be purchased. Several content sources are available for Android mobile devices:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Google Play, as shown in Figure 1</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Amazon App Store</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Androidzoom</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>AppsAPK</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>1Mobile</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>There are many other websites where Android apps can be found. It is important to install apps only from trusted sources. If a questionable site contains a desired app, check Google Play or the Amazon App Store to see if it can be downloaded from there instead. Apps downloaded from trusted sources are less likely to contain malicious code. The Google Play store only allows installation of apps on devices that are compatible with the device.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Sometimes a website contains a Quick Response (QR) code, as shown in Figure 2. QR codes are similar to a bar code, but can contain much more information. To use a QR code, a special app accesses the camera on a mobile device to scan the code. The code contains a web link that allows the direct download of an app. Be careful when using QR codes, and only allow downloads and installations from trusted sources.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>On Android, applications are packaged into an archive format called Android Application Package or APK for short. When an Android application is compiled and ready for distribution, it is placed inside an APK file. Along with the app’s compiled code, the APK contains resources, certificates, and assets required for the app’s proper operation.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The Apple App Store, as shown in Figure 3, is the only content source that iOS users are allowed to use to get apps and content. This ensures that Apple has cleared the content to be free of harmful code, meet strict performance guidelines, and does not infringe on copyrights.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Similar to Apple's App Store and Google's Google Play, Microsoft launched its own application store in 2012. Starting with Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012, the Windows Store, as shown in Figure 4, allows Windows users to search, download and install Windows Store Apps (also known as Metro-style apps).</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Other types of content are also available for download. Like apps, some content is free, while other content must be purchased. Content that you currently own can also be loaded onto mobile devices through a data cable connection or over Wi-Fi. Some types of content that are available include:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Music </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Television programs</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Movies</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Magazines</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Books</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Push versus Pull</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>There are two main methods for installing apps and content on mobile devices: push and pull. When a user runs the Google Play app or the Apple App Store app from a mobile device, apps and content that are downloaded are pulled from a server to the device.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>With Android devices, a user can browse Google Play using any desktop or laptop computer and purchase content. The content is pushed to the Android device from the server. iOS users are able to purchase content from iTunes on a desktop or laptop computer that is then pushed to an iOS device.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>When an Android app is being installed, a list of all the required permissions is displayed, as shown in Figure 5. You must agree to grant the listed permissions to the app so that it can be installed. Always read the list of permissions carefully and do not install apps that request permission to access items and features that it should not need.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Sideloading</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>There is another way to install apps on Android mobile devices. Apps can be downloaded from different sources on the Internet and transferred to a mobile device through Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, data cable, or other methods. This is called sideloading. Sideloading an application is not recommended, because many sources for apps cannot be trusted. Only install apps from trusted sources and developers.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Note: </b>iOS devices do not support sideloading by default.</p>
