        <h1>Overview of Passcode Locks</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Smartphones, tablets, and other mobile devices contain sensitive data. If a mobile device is lost, anyone who finds the device has access to contacts, text messages, and web accounts. One method to help prevent theft of private information from mobile devices is to use a passcode lock. A passcode lock locks a device and puts it in a power-saving state. The lock can also be delayed to engage after a specified amount of time passes after the device goes into the power-saving state. One common method for placing a mobile device into a sleep state is by quickly pressing the main power button. The device can also be set to enter a sleep state after a certain amount of time.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Many different types of passcode locks are available, as shown in Figure 1. Some types of passcode locks are more difficult to guess than others. The passcode must be entered each time the device is turned on or resumes from a power-saving state. These are some common types of passcode locks:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>None -</b> Removes any type of existing passcode lock for that device.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Swipe -</b> The user slides an icon, such as a lock or arrow, to unlock the device. This option is the least secure.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Pattern -</b> Locks the device when the user slides a finger over the screen in a certain pattern. To unlock the device, the exact pattern must be repeated on the screen.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>PIN -</b> Uses a private Personal Identification Number (PIN) to secure the device. A PIN is a series of numbers. When the PIN is entered correctly, the device unlocks.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Password -</b> Uses a password to secure the device. This option is the least convenient, especially if the word is complicated or long, but can be very secure.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Simple Passcode -</b> iOS devices only. When this option is set to On, the passcode must be a four-digit number. When set to Off, more complex passwords using characters, numbers, and symbols can be used.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Touch ID -</b> iOS devices only. Starting with the iPhone 5S, it is also possible to unlock an iOS device based on the user's fingerprints. The Home button in selected iPhone devices contain a fingerprint scanner that can be used to unlock the device, authorize payments and access to apps. Although Google has announced similar feature, fingerprint unlocking was not very popular among Android devices at the time this chapter was written.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>To set a passcode on an Android device, use the following path:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Settings > Security > Screen Lock ></b> Choose the type of passcode to use from the list, and set the remaining Screen Security settings.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>After a passcode is set, it must be entered each time the device is turned on or resumes from a power-saving state.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Android 5.0 (Lollipop) allows an extra set of unlock options, as shown in Figure 2. Placed under the Smart Lock feature, the extended Android unlock options are:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Trusted Devices - </b>This feature unlocks the Android phone or tablet whenever it is paired with a specific Bluetooth device or NFC tag of the user's choice. For example, it is convenient to be able to keep the Android phone or tablet unlocked when paired to a car's Bluetooth. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Trusted Places - </b>By using the GPS chip built into the device, Android allows the user to define home and work locations. The device will no longer require unlocking when it is in either one of those locations.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Trusted Face - </b>When activated, Trusted Face allows Android to unlock itself based on a pre-registered image of the user's face.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Trusted Voice - </b>This feature relies on the user's unique voiceprint to unlock the Android device when a registered user says "Okay Google".</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>On-body detection - </b>This feature will use the device's accelerometer to detect if the user has the device on his possession. By detecting some specific pattern of movement, Android assumes the device is in the user's hands, pocket or bag and will not require unlocking until it is set down by the user. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>To set a Smart Lock on an Android device, use the following path:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Settings > Security > Smart Lock</b>
            <b>></b> Choose the type of lock to use from the list, and set the remaining details based on the chosen option.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>To set a passcode on an iOS device, use the following path:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Settings > Touch ID & Passcode > </b>Turn Passcode On. Enter a four-digit number, as shown in Figure 3. Enter the same number a second time for verification. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>To use Touch ID, the user must register at least one fingerprint and can register up to five fingerprints. Touch ID configuration and behavior can also be set in the screen described above.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Note</b>: To increase security, some services will force the user to create a passcode lock before they can be enabled. VPN and Microsoft Exchange accounts are two examples of such services.</p>
