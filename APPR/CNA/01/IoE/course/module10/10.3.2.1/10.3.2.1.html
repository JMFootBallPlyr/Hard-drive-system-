        <h1>Bluetooth for Mobile Devices</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Mobile devices connect using many different methods. Cellular and Wi-Fi can be difficult to configure, and require extra equipment, such as towers and access points. Cable connections are not always practical when connecting headsets or speakers. Bluetooth technology provides a simple way for mobile devices to connect to each other and to wireless accessories. Bluetooth is wireless, automatic, and uses very little power, which helps conserve battery life. Up to eight Bluetooth devices can be connected together at any one time. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>These are some examples of how mobile devices use Bluetooth:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Hands-free headset</b> - A small earpiece with a microphone used for making and receiving calls, as shown in Figure 1.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Keyboard or mouse</b> - A keyboard or mouse can be connected to a mobile device to make input easier.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Stereo control</b> - A mobile device can connect to a home or car stereo to play music.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Car speakerphone</b> - A device that contains a speaker and a microphone used for making and receiving calls.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Tethering </b>- To synchronize data, share files, or share an Internet connection, a mobile device can be connected to another device over a physical cable such as a USB cable, or using a wireless connection such as Wi-Fi or Bluetooth.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Mobile speaker</b> - Portable speakers can connect to mobile devices to provide high-quality audio without a stereo system.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>Figure 2 shows a Bluetooth keyboard and a Bluetooth media player found by an Android device.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Bluetooth is a networking standard that has two levels, physical and protocol. At the physical level, Bluetooth is a radio frequency standard. At the protocol level, devices agree on when bits are sent, how they are sent, and that what is received is the same as what was sent.</p>
