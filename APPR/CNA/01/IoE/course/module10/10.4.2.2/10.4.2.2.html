        <h1>Security</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Despite continued efforts to create a perfectly secure operating system, vulnerabilities continue to be found. Malicious users probe operating systems searching for vulnerabilities in the code. When a vulnerability is found, it can be used as basis for the creation of a virus or other malicious software.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>A number of measures can be taken to help prevent malicious software from infecting a computer system. The most common of these measures include operating system updates, firmware updates, antivirus, and antimalware.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Operating System Updates</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Also known as patches, OS updates are released periodically by OS companies to address any known vulnerability in their operating systems. While companies have update schedules, the release of unscheduled OS updates is common when a major vulnerability is found in the OS code. Modern operating systems will alert the user when updates are available for download and installation, but the user can check for updates at any time. Figure 1 shows an update alert window for Apple OS X.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>To manually check and install updates on Ubuntu Linux, as shown in Figure 2, use the following path:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Click <b>Dash ></b> type <b>software updater ></b> click <b>Software Updater</b> icon</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>To manually check and install updates on OS X, as shown in Figure 3, use the following path:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Click the Apple logo on the upper left corner of the screen <b>></b> Select <b>About This Mac ></b> Click <b>Software Updateâ€¦ ></b> Select the <b>Update</b> Tab</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Firmware Updates</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Usually held in non-volatile memory, such as ROM or Flash, firmware is a type of software designed to provide low-level functionality for a device. Firmware is commonly found in embedded devices, such as digital watches, traffic lights and home appliances. It is also common in computers and computer peripherals, digital cameras, and cell phones. Firmware is susceptible to vulnerabilities and software exploits; however, the process for updating firmware can be more complicated than with operating systems. Check for firmware updates with the manufacturer and update the system if new versions are available. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Antivirus and Antimalware</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>In general, antivirus and antimalware rely on code signatures to operate. Signatures or signature files are files containing a sample of the code used by viruses and malware. Based on these signature files, antivirus and antimalware scan the contents of a computer disk comparing the contents of the files stored on the disk with the samples stored in the signature file. If a match is found, the antivirus or antimalware alerts the user of the possible presence of malware.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>New malware is created and released every day; therefore, the signature files of antivirus and antimalware programs must be updated just as frequently.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Security Credentials Manager</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Usernames, passwords, digital certificates, encryption keys are just a few of the security credentials associated to a user. Due to the increasing number of necessary security credentials, modern operating systems include a service to manage them. Applications and other services can then request and utilize the credentials stored by the security credentials manager service.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Gnome-keyring is a security credentials manager for Ubuntu Linux. To access Gnome-Keyring on Ubuntu Linux, as shown in Figure 4, use the following path:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Click <b>Dash ></b> Search for <b>Key ></b> Click <b>Passwords and Keys</b></p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Keychain is a security credentials manager for OS X. To access Keychain on OS X, as shown in Figure 5, use the following path:</p>
          <p>
            <b>Applications > Utilities > Keychain Access</b>
          </p>
