        <h1>Virtual Printers</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Virtual printing does not send a print job to a printer within your local network. Instead, the print software either sends the job to a file or transmits the information to a remote destination in the cloud for printing.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Typical methods for sending a print job to a file include the following:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Print to file</b> - Originally, print to file saved your data in a file with the .prn extension. The .prn file then could be quickly printed at any time without opening the original document. Print to file can now save in other formats, as shown in Figure 1.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Print to PDF</b> - Adobe’s Portable Document Format (PDF) was released as an open standard in 2008. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Print to XPS</b>  - Introduced by Microsoft in Windows Vista, the XML Paper Specification (XPS) format was meant to be an alternative to PDF.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Print to image</b> - To prevent others from easily copying the content in a document, you can choose to print to an image file format, such as JPG or TIFF. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>Cloud printing is sending a print job to a remote printer, as shown in Figure 2. The printer could be at any location within your organization’s network. Some printing companies provide software that you can install and then send print jobs to their closest location for processing. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Another cloud printing example is Google Cloud Print, which allows you to connect your printer to the web. Once connected, you can send print jobs to your printer from anywhere.</p>
