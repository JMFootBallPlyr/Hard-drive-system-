        <h1>Hardware Print Servers</h1>
        <div>
          <p>A hardware print server is a simple device with a network card and memory. It connects to the network and communicates with the printer to enable print sharing. The print server in Figure 1 is connected to the printer through a USB cable. A hardware print server may be integrated with another device, such as a wireless router. In this case, the printer would connect directly to the wireless router, most likely through a USB cable. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Appleâ€™s AirPort Extreme shown in Figure 2 is an example of a hardware print server. Through the AirPrint service, the AirPort Extreme can share a printer with any device on the network.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Hardware print servers allow many users on a network to access a single printer. A hardware print server can manage network printing through either wired or wireless connections. An advantage of using a hardware print server is that the server accepts incoming print jobs from computers, thereby freeing the computers for other tasks. A hardware print server is always available to users, unlike a printer shared from a user's computer. </p>
