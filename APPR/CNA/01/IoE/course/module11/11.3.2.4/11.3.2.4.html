        <h1>Dedicated Printer Servers</h1>
        <div>
          <p>For larger networking environments with multiple LANs and many users, a dedicated print server is needed to manage printing services, as shown in the figure. A dedicated print server is more powerful than a hardware print server.  It handles client print jobs in the most efficient manner and can manage more than one printer at a time. A dedicated print server must have the following resources to meet the requests of print clients:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Powerful processor</b> - Because the dedicated print server uses its processor to manage and route printing information, it must be fast enough to handle all incoming requests. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Adequate hard disk space</b> - A dedicated print server captures print jobs from clients, places them in a print queue, and sends them to the printer in a timely manner. This process requires the computer to have enough storage space to hold these jobs until completed. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Adequate memory</b> - The processor and RAM handle sending print jobs to a printer. If memory is not large enough to handle an entire print job, the hard drive must send the job, which is much slower. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
