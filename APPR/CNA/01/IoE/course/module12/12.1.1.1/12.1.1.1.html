        <h1>Malware</h1>

          <p>Computers and the data contained on them must be secured against malware:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Malware is any software created to perform malicious acts. The word malware is an abbreviation of <b>mal</b>icious soft<b>ware</b>.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>It is usually installed on a computer without the knowledge of the user. These programs open extra windows on the computer or change the computer configuration. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Malware is capable of modifying web browsers to open specific web pages that are not the desired web page. This is known as browser redirection. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>It is also capable of collecting information stored on the computer without the userâ€™s consent.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>The first and most common type of malware is a computer <i>virus</i>. A virus is transferred to another computer through email, USB drives, file transfers, and even instant messaging. The virus hides by attaching itself to computer code, software, or documents on the computer. When the file is accessed, the virus executes and infects the computer. Examples of what a virus can do are listed in Figure 1.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Another type of malware is a <i>Trojan horse</i>. A Trojan horse usually looks like a useful program but it carries malicious code. For example, Trojan horses are often provided with free online games. These games are downloaded to the user computer but also contain a Trojan horse. While playing the game, the Trojan horse is installed on the user's system and continues operating even after the game has been closed. There are several types of Trojan horses as described in the table in Figure 2.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Over the years, malware has continued to evolve. The table in Figure 3 describes other types of malware.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>To detect, disable, and remove malware before it infects a computer, always use antivirus software, antispyware, and adware removal tools. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>It is important to know that these software programs become outdated quickly. Therefore, it is the responsibility of the technician to apply the most recent updates, patches, and virus definitions as part of a regular maintenance schedule. Many organizations establish a written security policy stating that employees are not permitted to install any software that is not provided by the company. </p>
