        <h1>Malicious Software Protection Programs</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Malware includes viruses, worms, Trojan horses, keyloggers, spyware, and adware. These are designed to invade privacy, steal information, damage the system, or delete corrupt data. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>It is important that you protect computers and mobile devices using reputable antimalware software. The following types of antimalware programs are available:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Antivirus protection</b> - Program continuously monitors for viruses. When a virus is detected, the user is warned, and the program attempts to quarantine or delete the virus, as shown in Figure 1.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Adware protection</b> – Program continuously looks for programs that display advertising on your computer.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Phishing protection</b> – Program blocks the IP addresses of known phishing websites and warns the user about suspicious sites.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Spyware protection</b> – Program scans for keyloggers and other spyware.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Trusted / untrusted sources </b>– Program warns you about unsafe programs about to be installed or unsafe websites before they are visited.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>It may take several different programs and multiple scans to completely remove all malicious software. Run only one malware protection program at a time.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Several reputable security organizations such as McAfee, Symantec, Kaspersky, offer all-inclusive malware protection for computers and mobile devices.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Be cautious of malicious rogue antivirus products that may appear while browsing the Internet. Most of these rogue antivirus products display an ad or pop-up that looks like an actual Windows warning window, as shown in Figure 2. They usually state that the computer is infected and must be cleaned. Clicking anywhere inside the window may begin the download and installation of the malware. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>When faced with a warning window that is suspect, never click inside the warning window. Close the tab or the browser to see if the warning window goes away. If the tab or browser does not close, press ALT+F4 to close the window or use the task manager to end the program. If the warning window does not go away, scan the computer using a known, good antivirus or adware protection program to ensure that the computer is not infected.</p>
