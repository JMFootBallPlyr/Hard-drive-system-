        <h1>Remediating Infected Systems</h1>
        <div>
          <p>When a malware protection program detects that a computer is infected, it removes or quarantines the threat. But the computer is most likely still at risk. The first step to remediating an infected computer is to remove the computer from the network to prevent other computers from becoming infected. Physically unplug all network cables from the computer and disable all wireless connections. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The next step is to follow any incident response policies that are in place. This may include notifying IT personnel, saving log files to removable media, or turning off the computer. For a home user, update the malicious software protection programs that are installed and perform full scans of all media installed in the computer. Many antivirus programs can be set to run on system start before loading Windows. This allows the program to access all areas of the disk without being affected by the operating system or any malware.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Viruses and worms can be difficult to remove from a computer. Software tools are required to remove viruses and repair the computer code that the virus has modified. These software tools are provided by operating system manufacturers and security software companies. Make sure that you download these tools from a legitimate site.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Boot the computer in Safe Mode to prevent most drivers from loading. Install additional malware protection programs and perform full scans to remove or quarantine additional malware. It may be necessary to contact a specialist to ensure that the computer has been completely cleaned. In some cases, the computer must be reformatted and restored from a backup, or the operating system may need to be reinstalled.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The system restore service may include infected files in a restore point. After the computer has been cleaned of any malware, the system restore files should be deleted, as shown in the figure.</p>
