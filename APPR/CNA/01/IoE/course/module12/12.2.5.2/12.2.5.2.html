        <h1>Service Set Identifiers</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Because radio waves are used to transmit data in wireless networks, it is easy for attackers to monitor and collect data without physically connecting to a network. Attackers gain access to a network by being within range of an unprotected wireless network. A technician needs to configure access points and wireless NICs to an appropriate level of security.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>When installing wireless services, apply wireless security techniques immediately to prevent unwanted access to the network. Wireless access points should be configured with basic security settings that are compatible with the existing network security. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The Service Set Identifier (SSID) is the name of the wireless network. A wireless router or access point broadcasts the SSID by default so that wireless devices can detect the wireless network. When the SSID broadcast has been disabled on the wireless router or access point, as shown in the figure, manually enter the SSID on wireless devices to connect to the wireless network.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Disabling the SSID broadcast provides very little security. If the SSID broadcast is disabled, a user who wants to connect to the wireless network and who knows the SSID of that network can simply enter it manually. When a computer is searching for a wireless network, it will broadcast the SSID. An advanced hacker can easily intercept this information and use it to impersonate your router and capture your credentials.</p>
