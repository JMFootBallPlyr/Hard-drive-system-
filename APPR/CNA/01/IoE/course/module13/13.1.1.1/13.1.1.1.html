        <h1>Relationship Between Communication Skills and Troubleshooting</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Think of a time when you had to call a repair person to get something fixed. Did it feel like an emergency to you? Perhaps you had a bad experience with a repair person. Are you likely to call that same person to fix a problem again?</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Perhaps you had a good experience with a repair person. That person listened to you as you explained your problem and then asked you a few questions to get more information. Are you likely to call that person to fix a problem again?</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>A technicianâ€™s good communication skills are an aid in the troubleshooting process. It takes time and experience to develop good communication and troubleshooting skills. As your hardware, software, and OS knowledge increases, your ability to quickly determine a problem and find a solution will improve. The same principle applies to developing communication skills. The more you practice good communication skills, the more effective you will become when working with customers. A knowledgeable technician who uses good communication skills will always be in demand in the job market.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>To troubleshoot a computer, you need to learn the details of the problem from the customer. Most people who need a computer problem fixed are probably feeling some stress. If you establish a good rapport with the customer, the customer might relax a bit. A relaxed customer is more likely to be able to provide the information that you need to determine the source of the problem and then fix it.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Speaking directly with the customer is usually the first step in resolving the computer problem. As a technician, you also have access to several communication and research tools. All these resources can be used to help gather information for the troubleshooting process.</p>
