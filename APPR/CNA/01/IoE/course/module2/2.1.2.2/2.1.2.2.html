        <h1>Power Fluctuation Types</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Voltage is a measure of energy required to move a charge from one location to another. The movement of electrons is called current. Computer circuits need voltage and current to operate electronic components. When the voltage in a computer is not accurate or steady, computer components might not operate correctly. Unsteady voltages are called power fluctuations.</p>
          <p>The following types of AC power fluctuations can cause data loss or hardware failure:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Blackout</b> - Complete loss of AC power. A blown fuse, damaged transformer, or downed power line can cause a blackout. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Brownout</b> - Reduced voltage level of AC power that lasts for a period of time. Brownouts occur when the power line voltage drops below 80 percent of the normal voltage level and when electrical circuits are overloaded. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Noise</b> - Interference from generators and lightning. Noise results in poor quality power, which can cause errors in a computer system. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Spike</b> - Sudden increase in voltage that lasts for a short period and exceeds 100 percent of the normal voltage on a line. Spikes can be caused by lightning strikes, but can also occur when the electrical system comes back on after a blackout. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Power surge</b> - Dramatic increase in voltage above the normal flow of electrical current. A power surge lasts for a few nanoseconds, or one-billionth of a second.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
