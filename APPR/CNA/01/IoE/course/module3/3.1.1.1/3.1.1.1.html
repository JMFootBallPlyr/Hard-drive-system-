        <h1>Open the Case</h1>
        <div>
          <p>When building or repairing a computer, it is important that you prepare the workspace before opening the computer case. You want adequate lighting, good ventilation, and a comfortable room temperature. The workbench or table should be accessible from all sides. Avoid cluttering the surface of the work area with tools and computer components. Place an antistatic mat on the table to help prevent ESD damage to electronics. It is helpful to use small containers to hold screws and other parts as you remove them.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Computer cases are produced in a variety of form factors. Recall that form factors refer to the size and shape of the case. There are also different methods for opening cases. To learn how to open a particular computer case, consult the user manual or manufacturerâ€™s website. </p>
          <p>Most computer cases are opened in one of the following ways:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>The computer case cover is removed as one piece.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>The top and side panels of the case are removed.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>The top of the case is removed before the side panels can be removed.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>A latch is pulled to release the side panel, which can swing open.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The figure displays a new, empty ATX computer case. The case, or chassis, is an empty shell with pre-installed fan(s) and cables to connect the fan(s) and front panel buttons, LED indicators, and USB, audio, or other connections.</p>
