        <h1>Install Motherboard</h1>
        <div>
          <p>The motherboard is now ready to be installed in the computer case. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>To install the motherboard, follow these steps:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 1. </b>Choose the proper motherboard standoffs for the case. A motherboard printed circuit board (PCB) cannot touch any metal portion of the computer case. Therefore, it must be mounted to the case using special plastic or metal standoffs such as the ones shown in Figure 1. </p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 2.</b> Install the standoffs in the computer case at the same locations of the mounting holes in the motherboard. Install only the standoffs that align with the holes in the motherboard, as shown in Figure 2, for an ATX motherboard. Installing additional standoffs might prevent the motherboard from being seated properly in the computer case, or cause damage.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 3. </b>Install the I/O connector plate in the back of the computer case, as shown in Figure 3. The I/O plate has cutouts that match the connector layout of the motherboard. </p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 4. </b>Align the I/O connectors on the back of the motherboard with the openings in the I/O plate.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 5. </b>Align the screw holes of the motherboard with the standoffs.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 6. </b>Insert all the motherboard screws and hand-tighten all of them before tightening them with a screwdriver. Do not over tighten the screws.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Installation Tips</b>: Push the motherboard against the I/O connector plate to align the mounting holes with the standoffs and start the first screw. Also, it is helpful to use a part retriever to place screws into the mounting holes and hand-tighten them.</p>
