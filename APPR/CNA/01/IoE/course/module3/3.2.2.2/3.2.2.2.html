        <h1>BIOS Configurations</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Another function of the BIOS setup program is to customize specific aspects of the computer hardware to fit individual needs. The features that can be customized are determined by the BIOS manufacturer and version. Before making changes to the BIOS, it is important to have a clear understanding of how the changes can affect the computer. Incorrect settings can have an adverse effect.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Main BIOS configuration settings to configure include:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Time and Date</b> - The main page of the BIOS has a System Time field and a System Date field to set the system clock, as shown in Figure 1.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Disable Devices</b> - You can configure advanced BIOS settings to disable devices that are not needed or not used by the computer, as shown in Figure 2. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Boot Order </b>- Shortly after completing POST, the computer attempts to load the operating system. The BIOS checks the first device in the boot order list for a bootable partition. The boot order list, or boot sequence, is an ordered list of devices from which the computer is allowed to boot. If the device has no bootable partition, the computer checks the next device in the list. When a device with a bootable partition is found, the BIOS checks for an installed operating system. This list is typically located in the BIOS under the Boot tab, as shown in Figure 3. You can designate hard drives, optical drives, network boot, USB, and flash media in the boot order. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Clock Speed</b> - Some BIOS setup programs allow you to change the CPU clock speed, as shown in Figure 4. Reducing the CPU clock speed makes the computer run slower and cooler and is referred to as underclocking. This might result in less noise from fans and can be useful if a quieter computer is desired, such as in a home theater or bedroom. CPU overclocking is increasing the CPU clock speed to make the computer run faster but also hotter, possibly causing the computer to be louder due to increased fan speeds. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Virtualization</b> - Virtualization technology allows a computer to run multiple operating systems in separate files or partitions. To accomplish this, a computer virtualization program emulates the characteristics of an entire computer, including the hardware, BIOS, operating system, and programs. Enable the virtualization setting in the BIOS for a computer that will be using virtualization technology, as shown in Figure 5.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The table in Figure 6 provides BIOS setting suggestions.</p>
