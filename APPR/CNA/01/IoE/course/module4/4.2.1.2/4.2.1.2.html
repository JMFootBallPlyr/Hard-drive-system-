        <h1>Identify the Problem</h1>
        <div>
          <p>The first step in the troubleshooting process is to identify the problem. During this step, gather as much information as possible from the customer and from the computer. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Conversation Etiquette</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>When you are talking to the customer, follow these guidelines:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Ask direct questions to gather information. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Do not use industry jargon.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Do not talk down to the customer. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Do not insult the customer. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Do not accuse the customer of causing the problem. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>Figure 1 lists some of the information to gather from the customer.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Open-Ended and Closed-Ended Questions</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Open-ended questions allow customers to explain the details of the problem in their own words. Use open-ended questions to obtain general information. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Based on the information from the customer, you can proceed with closed-ended questions. Closed-ended questions generally require a yes or no answer. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Documenting Responses</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Document the information from the customer in the work order, in the repair log, and in your repair journal. Write down anything that you think might be important for you or another technician. The small details often lead to the solution of a difficult or complicated problem. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Beep Codes</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Each BIOS manufacturer has a unique beep sequence, a combination of long and short beeps, for hardware failures. When troubleshooting, power on the computer and listen. As the system proceeds through the POST, most computers emit one beep to indicate that the system is booting properly. If there is an error, you might hear multiple beeps. Document the beep code sequence, and research the code to determine the specific problem. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>BIOS Information</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>If the computer boots and stops after the POST, investigate the BIOS settings. A device might not be detected or configured properly. Refer to the motherboard documentation to ensure that the BIOS settings are correct. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Event Viewer</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>When system, user, or software errors occur on a computer, the Event Viewer is updated with information about the errors. The Event Viewer application, shown in Figure 2, records the following information about the problem:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>What problem occurred </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Date and time of the problem </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Severity of the problem </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Source of the problem </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Event ID number </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Which user was logged in when the problem occurred </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>Although the Event Viewer lists details about the error, you might need to further research the problem to determine a solution.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Device Manager</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The Device Manager, shown in Figure 3, displays all the devices that are configured on a computer. The operating system flags the devices that are not operating correctly with an error icon. A yellow circle with an exclamation point (!) indicates that the device is in a problem state. A red circle with an X means that the device is disabled. A yellow question mark (?) indicates that the system does not know which driver to install for the hardware. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Task Manager</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The Task Manager, shown in Figure 4, displays the applications and background processes that are currently running. With the Task Manager, you can close applications that have stopped responding. You can also monitor the performance of the CPU and virtual memory; view all processes that are currently running, and view information about the network connections.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Diagnostic Tools</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Conduct research to determine which software is available to help diagnose and solve problems. There are many programs to help you troubleshoot hardware. Manufacturers of system hardware usually provide diagnostic tools of their own. For instance, a hard drive manufacturer might provide a tool to boot the computer and diagnose why the hard drive does not start the operating system.</p>
