          <p>An operating system (OS) has a number of functions. One of its main tasks is to act as an interface between the user and the hardware connected to the computer. The operating system also controls other functions:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Software resources</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Memory allocation and all peripheral devices</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Common services to computer application software</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>From digital watches to computers, almost all computers require an operating system before they can be operated, hence the name.</p>
          <p>To understand the capabilities of an operating system, it is important to first understand some basic terms. The following terms are often used when describing operating systems:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Multi-user </b>- Two or more users have individual accounts that allow them to work with programs and peripheral devices at the same time.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Multitasking </b>- The computer is capable of operating multiple applications at the same time.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Multiprocessing </b>- The operating system can support two or more CPUs.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Multithreading </b>- A program can be broken into smaller parts that are loaded as needed by the operating system. Multithreading allows different parts of a program to be run at the same time.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>The OS boots the computer and manages the file system. Operating systems can support more than one user, task, or CPU.</p>
