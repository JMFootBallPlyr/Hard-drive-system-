        <h1>OS Installation with Default Settings</h1>
        <div>
          <p>The installation process for Windows OS is similar across Windows 8.x, 7 and Vista. The process is described in detail below using Windows 8.1 as an example.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Windows 8.1</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>When a computer boots with the Windows 8.1 installation disc (or USB flash drive), the installation wizard presents two options, as shown in Figure 1:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Install Now</b> – Allows the users to install Windows 8.1.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Repair your computer</b> - Opens the Recovery Environment to repair an installation. Select the Windows 8.1 installation that needs repair and click <b>Next</b>. Select from a number of recovery tools, such as Startup Repair. Startup Repair locates and repairs problems with the OS files. If Startup Repair does not solve the problem, additional options, such as System Restore or System Image Recovery, are available.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Note</b>: Before performing a repair installation, back up important files to a different physical location, such as a second hard drive, optical disc, or USB storage device.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>For this example, select the <b>Install now</b> option. As shown in Figure 2, two options are available:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Upgrade: Install Windows and keep files, settings and applications</b> - Upgrades Windows but keeps your current files, settings, and programs. Use this option to repair an installation.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Custom: Install Windows only (advanced)</b> - Installs a new copy of Windows in your choice of location and allows you to change disks and partitions.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>If existing Windows installations are not found, the Upgrade option is disabled.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Note</b>: When only upgrading the Windows OS, the previous Windows folder is kept, along with the Documents and Settings and Program Files folders. During the Windows 8.1 installation, these folders are moved to a folder named Windows.old. You can copy files from the previous installation to the new installation.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The installer will copy the files (Figure 3) and reboot a few times before presenting the Personalization screen. To simplify the process, Windows 8.1 will automatically partition and format the drive if no partitions are found. The installation will also erase any data previously stored in the drive. If partitions exist in the drive, the installer will show them and allow for partition scheme customization.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>In Personalization screen (Figure 4) the installer asks for a name for the computer and allows the user to select a color to be used as the basis for a theme.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The installer will now attempt to connect to the network. If a network card (NIC) is present and a cable is connected, the installer will request a network address. If a wireless card is installed, the installer will list the wireless networks in range and prompt the user to pick one and provide the password for it, if needed. Figure 5 shows the installer prompting the wireless network password. If no network is available at this point, the network configuration is skipped, but can be done later after the system is installed.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Figure 6 presents a list of the express settings for the installer. These are the values recommended by the installer after a computer scan. Click <b>Use express settings</b> to accept and use the default settings. Alternatively, it is possible to change the default settings by clicking <b>Customize</b>.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The installer prompts for an email address for signing into a Microsoft account. Although optional, this grants access to the Windows Online Store. Enter an email address and click <b>Next</b>, as shown in Figure 7. To skip the account linkage and create a local user account, click <b>Sign In without a Microsoft account</b>.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The installer displays this screen (Figure 8) if no Microsoft account was created. The installer allows the user to create a Microsoft account or use a local account. Figure 9 shows the screen requesting information for the creation of a local user account.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Windows will finish the process and display the Start Screen, as shown in Figure 10. When the Windows 8.1 Start Screen is presented, the installation is complete and the computer is ready for use.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Depending on the current location of the computer and version of the OS, you are prompted to select a method for organizing computers and sharing resources on a network. Workgroup, Homegroup, and Domain are the different ways for organizing the computers in a network.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Workgroup</b> – All the computers in the same workgroup are allowed to share files and resources over a local area network. The sharing settings are used to share specific resources on the network.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Homegroup</b> – Homegroup is a new feature that started in Windows 7 that allows computers on the same network to automatically share files and printers.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Domain</b> - A computer on a domain is governed by a central administrator and must follow the rules and procedures set by the administrator. A domain provides users with the ability to share files and devices.</li>
            </ul>
