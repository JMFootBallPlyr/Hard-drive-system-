        <h1>HomeGroup and Network and Sharing Center</h1>
        <div>
          <p>
            <b>HomeGroup (Windows 8 and 7)</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>HomeGroup allows two or more computers running Windows 7 or newer on your network to share printers, media files and document libraries. A homegroup is created automatically, and the network location must be set to Home. To increase security, the homegroup is password-protected. It also allows the users to choose the files that are shared. Other users cannot change the shared files unless they are granted permission.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Join or Create a Homegroup</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>If a homegroup already exists on the network, you may join the homegroup. If no homegroup exists on the network, a new homegroup can be created. During the creation process, you can choose files or devices to be shared and set the permission levels, as shown in Figure 1. A password is generated at the end of the process to add other computers to the homegroup.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>If your computer belongs to a domain, the computer can join a homegroup to access shared resources on the network, but the computer cannot share its resources or create a new homegroup.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>To join a homegroup, use the following path:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Control Panel > HomeGroup > Join Now</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>To create a new homegroup, use the following path:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Control Panel > HomeGroup > Create a homegroup</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Create a Workgroup or Join a Workgroup or Domain</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>In Windows 7 and Vista, Windows automatically creates and names a workgroup in a network. You can join this workgroup or create a new one. Alternatively, you can join a domain. To join a domain, you need to know the domain name and have a user account in the domain.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>To create a workgroup, join a workgroup, or join a domain, as shown in Figure 2, use the following path:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Start </b>> Right-Click <b>Computer</b> > <b>Properties</b> > Under the Computer name, domain, and workgroup settings, select <b>Change settings</b></p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Network and Sharing Center</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Network and Sharing Center allows an administrator to configure and review nearly all network operations in a Windows computer. Figures 3, 4, and 5 show the Network and Sharing Center for Windows 8, 7, and Vista, respectively.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Network and Sharing Center shows how your computer connects to a network. Internet connectivity, if present, will also be displayed here. The bottom part of the window displays and allows the configuration of shared network resources. Some useful and common network-related tasks are displayed on the left pane of the window.</p>
