        <h1>Windows CLI Commands</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Before computers had a GUI, programs and data were accessed using a command line interface (CLI). The CLI is a text-only environment where commands are issued to run programs, create and move files and folders, and perform all other functions of the computer. The CLI did not use a mouse or other input device. The CLI is still available from within Windows, although with limited capability. When troubleshooting problems with the OS, you may need to use CLI commands and options to perform tasks.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>To access the CLI in Windows, search for <b>command</b>.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>After the command window opens, you can enter commands to perform specific tasks. The figure describes the most common commands, how to use them, and what they do.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>If you are denied the use of one of these commands, you may need to access the CLI as Administrator. To access the CLI as an administrator in Windows, search for <b>command</b>. Next, right-click <b>Command Prompt</b><b>></b> click <b>Run as administrator</b><b>></b> click <b>Yes</b>. You will need to provide the administrator password to complete the command.</p>
