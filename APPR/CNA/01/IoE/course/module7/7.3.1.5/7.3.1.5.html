          <p>
            <b>Patch Panels</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>A patch panel is commonly used as a place to collect incoming cable runs from the various networking devices throughout a facility, as shown in Figure 1. It provides a connection point between PCs and the switches or routers. A patch panel can be unpowered or powered. A powered patch panel can regenerate weak signals before sending them on to the next device.</p>

          <p>
            <b>Repeaters</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Regenerating weak signals is the primary purpose of a repeater, as shown in Figure 2. Repeaters are also called extenders because they extend the distance a signal can travel. In todayâ€™s networks, repeaters are most often used to regenerate signals in fiber-optic cables. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Power over Ethernet (PoE)</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>A PoE switch transfers small amounts of DC current over an Ethernet cable, along with the data, to power PoE devices. Low voltage devices that support PoE, such as Wi-Fi access points, surveillance video devices, and IP phones, can be powered from remote locations. Devices that support PoE can receive power over an Ethernet connection at distances up to 330 ft (100 m) away. Power can also be inserted in the middle of a cable run using a PoE injector, as shown in Figure 3.</p>
