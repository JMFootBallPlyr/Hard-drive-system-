        <h1>Network Addressing</h1>
        <div>
          <p>The fingerprint and addressed letters in Figure 1 are two ways of identifying a person. A person's fingerprints usually do not change. They provide a way to physically identify people. The mailing address of a person can change, as it relates to where the person lives or picks up mail. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Devices that are attached to a network have two addresses that are similar to a person’s fingerprints and a person’s mailing address. These two types of addresses are the Media Access Control (MAC) address and the IP address. The MAC address is hard coded onto the network interface card (NIC) by the manufacturer.  The address stays with the device regardless of what network the device is connected. A MAC address is 48 bits and can be represented in one of the three hexadecimal formats shown in Figure 2.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Note</b>: The binary and hexadecimal numbering systems are common in networking technologies. Converting between decimal, binary, and hexadecimal numbering systems is beyond the scope of this course. Search the Internet to learn more about these numbering systems.</p>
