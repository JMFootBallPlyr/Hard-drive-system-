        <h1>Connecting the NIC</h1>
        <div>
          <p>To connect to a network, attach a straight-through Ethernet cable to the NIC port, as shown in the figure. In a home or small office network, the other end of the cable would probably be connected to an Ethernet port on a wireless router. In a business network, the computer would most likely connect to a wall jack which in turn connects to a network switch.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>NICs typically have one or more green or amber LED, or link lights as shown in the figure. These lights are used to indicate if there is a link connection and if there is activity. Green LEDs are often used to indicate an active link connection while amber LEDs are often used to indicate network activity.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Note</b>: The meaning of LED lights varies between network card manufacturers. Refer to the motherboard or network card documentation for more information.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>If the LEDs are not lit, then this indicates a problem. No activity can indicate a faulty NIC configuration, faulty cable, a faulty switch port, or even a faulty NIC. You might have to replace one or more of these devices to correct the problem.</p>
