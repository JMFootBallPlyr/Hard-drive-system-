        <h1>Docking Station Versus Port Replicator</h1>
        <div>
          <p>
            <b>Docking Station</b>
          </p>
          <p>A docking station allows a laptop to function as a desktop computer. Peripheral devices, such as monitor, mouse, and keyboard can be permanently connected to the docking station. When a user decides to use the laptop in desktop mode, the user connects the laptop to the docking station via the docking connector as shown in Figure 1.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The docking connector allows the laptop to communicate with the peripheral devices. Some docking stations can provide addition ports beyond what is available on the laptop, such as additional USB ports. The docking stations may also more built-in peripheral devices, such as speakers or an optical drive. For more information about the components located on the rear of the docking station, click the highlighted areas in Figure 2.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>When a laptop is connected to the docking station, it can be secured using a locking mechanism, as shown in Figure 3. Click the highlighted area for more information.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Many docking stations are proprietary and only work with particular laptops. Before buying a docking station, check the laptop documentation or the website of the manufacturer to determine the appropriate make and model for the laptop.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Port Replicator</b>
          </p>
          <p>A port replicator also allow a laptop to connect multiple peripheral devices quickly. The peripheral devices are plugged into the port replicator permanently, and the laptop usually connects to the port replicator via a USB port. A port replicator can provide a more universal solution by connecting to the laptop via the USB port. An advantage to using a port replicator is that multiple laptops from different vendors can use most, if not all, of its functionality.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The available connection types depend on the docking station, port replicator, and the make and model of the laptop:</p>
          <p>Manufacturer-specific and model-specific</p>
          <p>USB, FireWire, and Thunderbolt</p>
          <p>PC-Card or ExpressCard</p>
          <p>Most laptops can be docked when in use or while shut off. Adding devices when docking can be handled by plug-and-play technology or by using a separate hardware profile for the docked and undocked state. The docking stations and port replicators allow for easy connection and disconnection of a laptop from all of the peripherals to which it is connected.</p>
