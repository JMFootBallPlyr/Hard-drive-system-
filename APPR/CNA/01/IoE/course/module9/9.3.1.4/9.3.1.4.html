        <h1>SODIMM Memory</h1>
        <div>
          <p>The make and model of the laptop determines the type of RAM needed. It is important to select the memory type that is physically compatible with the laptop. Most desktop computers use memory that fits into a DIMM slot. Most laptops use a smaller profile memory chip that is called SODIMM. SODIMM has 72-pin and 100-pin configurations for support of 32-bit transfers and 144-pin, 200-pin, and 204-pin configurations for support of 64-bit transfers. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Note:</b> SODIMMs can be further classified as DDR, DDR2, and DDR3. Different laptop models require different types of SODIMMs.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Before purchasing and installing additional RAM, consult the laptop documentation or the website of the manufacturer for form-factor specifications. Use the documentation to find where to install RAM on the laptop. On most laptops, RAM is inserted into slots behind a cover on the underside of the case, as shown in Figure 1. On some laptops, the keyboard must be removed to access the RAM slots.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Consult the manufacturer of the laptop to confirm the maximum amount of RAM each slot can support. You can view the currently installed amount of RAM in the POST screen, BIOS, or System Properties window. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Figure 2 shows where the amount of RAM is displayed in the System utility.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>To replace or add memory, determine if the laptop has available slots and that it supports the quantity and type of memory to be added. In some instances, there are no available slots for the new SODIMM.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>To remove the existing SODIMM, follow these steps:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 1:</b> Remove the AC adapter and battery from the laptop.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 2</b>: Remove the screws on the cover above the memory socket to expose the module.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 3</b>: Press outward on the clips that hold the sides of the module.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 4</b>: Lift up to loosen the module from the slot and remove it.</p>
          <p>To install a SODIMM, follow these steps:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 1:</b> Align the notch of the memory module at a 45-degree angle and gently press it into the socket.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 2:</b> Gently press down on the memory module into the socket until the clips lock.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 3:</b> Replace the cover and install the screws.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 4:</b> Insert the battery and connect the AC adapter. Turn the computer on and access the System utility to ensure that the RAM has been identified successfully.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Note</b>: Throughout this chapter, steps are provided for replacing laptop hardware with a specific make and model of laptop. There are many different models of laptops. Not all laptops will have the same steps for hardware replacement. Consult the laptop repair manual before replacing any hardware.</p>
