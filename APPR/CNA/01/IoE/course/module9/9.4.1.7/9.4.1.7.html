        <h1>Accessories</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Mobile device accessories are not necessary for the functions of the devices as intended by the manufacturer. However, accessories can enhance the user’s experience. The accessories, except for protective covers, can be connected to the laptops and mobile devices via wired or wireless technologies.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Protective covers:</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Mobile devices are portable electronic devices. Cases and protective covers can protect these devices from physical damage during travel or use. Furthermore, some protective covers also provide protection from water damage.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Power sources (Figure 1):</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>External batteries / portable chargers</b> – While on the go, the external batteries can provide the extra power for mobile devices. Portable chargers, such as wireless QI, pronounced key, chargers, solar chargers and car chargers, can replenish power.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Docking stations</b> – These allow mobile devices to easily connect to other devices. Most docking stations will also act as a charger while the mobile device is connected. Some docking stations also have speakers or keyboards.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Some examples of power sources are shown in Figure 1.</p>
          <p>There are mobile device cases that contain an external battery. These cases make the device larger and heavier when the case is attached, but the battery life of the device is increased and an external battery or portable charge is no longer necessary.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Audio Accessories</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Headsets / ear buds </b>- These allow a user to listen to audio output privately. If the headset or ear buds have a microphone, the user can have phone conversation while keeping their hands free. Both wireless and wired connections are available.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Speakers</b> - These speakers can come in different colors, shapes and sizes. Speakers can also be wireless or wired.</li>
            </ul>

          <p></p>
          <p>Some examples of audio accessories are shown in Figure 2.</p>
