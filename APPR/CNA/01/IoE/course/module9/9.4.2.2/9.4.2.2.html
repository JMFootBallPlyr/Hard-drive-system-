        <h1>Specialty Devices</h1>
        <div>
          <p>There are many other types of smart devices. These devices benefit from network connectivity and advanced functions.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Global Positioning System</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Global Positioning System (GPS) is a satellite-based navigation system, as shown in Figure 1. GPS satellites are located in space and transmit signals back to Earth. The GPS receiver locks onto the signals and constantly calculates its position relative to these satellites. After the position has been determined, the GPS receiver calculates other information, such as speed and time and distance to a programmed destination.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Smart Cameras </b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>A smart camera, shown in Figure 2, allows images to be transferred onto a PC using built-in wireless connections. Furthermore, with Wi-Fi enabled, the images can be shared on social media, emailed, or transferred to cloud-based storage directly from the camera.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Some smart cameras can connect to other smart devices to add functionality. When the smart camera is connected to a smartphone, the smartphone controls some features on the camera such as remote control or displaying pictures on the smartphone from the camera. The smart camera can also connect to a smart TV to display images.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Electronic Readers</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>An electronic reader, or e-reader, shown in Figure 2, is a device optimized for reading electronic books, e-books, newspapers, and other documents. They have WiFi or cellular connectivity to download content. An e-reader has a similar form factor as a tablet, but the screen provides much better readability, especially in sunlight. E-readers are often lighter weight and have longer battery life than an average tablet. This is done by using electronic paper technology. This technology makes text and images look similar to ink on paper.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Phablets</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>A phablet is a mobile device with a size between a typical smartphone and a typical tablet. The phablet screen is about 5 to 7 inches (12.7 cm. to 17.8 cm.) measured diagonally. A phablet offers the portability and functionality of a smartphone with a larger screen.</p>
