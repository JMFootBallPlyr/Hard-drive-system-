        <h1>Chapter 9: Laptops and Mobile Devices</h1>
        <div>
          <p>This chapter discussed the features and functionality of laptops and mobile devices, as well as how to remove and install internal and external components. The following concepts from this chapter are important to remember:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Laptops and mobile devices are lightweight and can operate on battery power.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Laptops use the same types of ports as desktop computers so that peripheral devices can be interchangeable. Mobile devices can also use some of the same peripheral devices.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Essential input devices, such as a keyboard and track pad, are built into laptops to provide similar functionality as desktop computers. Some laptops and mobile devices use touchscreens as input devices.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>The internal components of laptops are typically smaller than desktop components because they are designed to fit into compact spaces and conserve energy. The internal components of mobile devices are usually connected to the circuit board to keep the device compact and light weight.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Laptops feature function keys that can be pressed in combination with the Fn key. The functions performed by these keys are specific to the laptop model.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Docking stations and port replicators can increase the functionality of laptops by providing the same types of ports that are featured on desktop computers. Some mobile devices use docking station to charge or use peripheral devices.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Laptops and mobile devices most commonly feature LCD or LED screens, many of which are touchscreen.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Backlights illuminate LCD and LED laptop displays. OLED displays have no backlight.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>The power settings of laptop batteries can be configured to ensure that power is used efficiently.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Laptops and mobile devices can feature a number of wireless technologies, including Bluetooth, Infrared, Wi-Fi and the ability to access Cellular WANs.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Laptops provide a number of expansion possibilities. Users can add memory to increase performance, make use of flash memory to increase storage capacity, or increase functionality by using expansion cards. Some mobile devices can add more storage capacity by upgrading or adding more flash memory, such as MicroSD cards.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Laptop components consist of CRUs and FRUs.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Laptop components should be cleaned regularly in order to extend the life of the laptop.</li>
            </ul>
