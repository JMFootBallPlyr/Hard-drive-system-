        <h1>Cases</h1>
        <div>
          <p>The case of a desktop computer houses the internal components such as the power supply, motherboard, central processing unit (CPU), memory, disk drives, and assorted adapter cards. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Cases are typically made of plastic, steel, or aluminum and provide the framework to support, protect, and cool the internal components. </p>
          <p>A device form factor refers to its physical design and look. Desktop computers are available in a variety of form factors including: </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Horizontal case</b> – These were popular with early computer systems. The computer case was horizontally oriented on the user desk with the monitor positioned on top. This form factor is no longer popular.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Full-Size Tower</b> – (Figure 1) This is a computer case which is oriented vertically. It is typically located on the floor under, or beside, a desk or table. It provides room for expansion to accommodate additional components such as disk drives, adapter cards, and more. It requires an external keyboard, mouse, and monitor. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Compact Tower </b>– (Figure 2) This is a smaller version of the full-size tower and is commonly found in the corporate environment. It may also be called a mini-tower or small form factor (SFF) model. It can be located on the user desk or on the floor. It provides limited room for expansion. It requires an external keyboard, mouse, and monitor. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>All-in-one</b> - (Figure 3) All of the computer system components are integrated into the display. They often include touch-screen input and built-in microphone and speakers. Depending on the model, all-in-one computers offer little to no expansion capabilities. It requires an external keyboard, mouse, and power supply.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Note</b>: This list is not exhaustive, as many case manufacturers have their own naming conventions. These  may include super tower, full tower, mid tower, mini tower, cube case, and more. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Computer components tend to generate a lot of heat; therefore, computer cases contain fans that move air through the case. As the air passes warm components, it absorbs heat and then exits the case. This process keeps the computer components from overheating. Cases are also designed to protect against static electricity damage. The computer’s internal components are grounded via attachment to the case. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Note</b>: Computer cases are also referred to as the computer chassis, cabinet, tower, housing, or simply box.</p>
