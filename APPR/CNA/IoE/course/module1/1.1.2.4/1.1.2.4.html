        <h1>Cooling Systems</h1>
        <div>
          <p>The flow of current between electronic components generates heat. Computer components perform better when kept cool. If the heat is not removed, the computer may run more slowly. If too much heat builds up, the computer could crash, or components can be damaged. Therefore, it is imperative that computers be kept cool.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Note</b>: Computers are kept cool using active and passive cooling solutions. Active solutions require power while passive solutions do not. </p>
          <p>Increasing the air flow in the computer case allows more heat to be removed. An active cooling solution uses fans inside of a computer case to blow out hot air, as shown in Figure 1. For increased air flow, some cases have multiple fans with cool air being brought in while another fan is blowing out hot air. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Inside the case, the CPU generates a lot of heat. To draw heat away from the CPU core, a heat sink is installed on top of it, as shown in Figure 2. The heat sink has a large surface area with metal fins to dissipate heat into the surrounding air. This is known as passive cooling. Between the heat sink and the CPU is a special thermal compound. The thermal compound increases the efficiency of heat transfer from the CPU to the heat sink by filling any tiny gaps between the two.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>CPUs that are overclocked or running multiple cores tend to generate excessive heat. It is a very common practice to install a fan on top of the heat sink, as shown in Figure 3. The fan moves heat away from the metal fins of the heatsink. This is known as active cooling.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Other components are also susceptible to heat damage and are often equipped with fans. Many video adapter cards have their own processor called a graphics-processing unit (GPU) which generates excessive heat. Some video adapter cards come equipped with one or more fans, as shown in Figure 4. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Computers with extremely fast CPUs and GPUs might use a water-cooling system, as shown in Figure 5. A metal plate is placed over the processor, and water is pumped over the top to collect the heat that the processor generates. The water is pumped to a radiator to disperse the heat into the air and the water is then recirculated.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>CPU fans make noise and can be annoying at high speeds. An alternative to cooling a CPU with a fan is a method that uses heat pipes. The heat pipe contains liquid that is permanently sealed at the factory and uses a system of cyclic evaporation and condensation. </p>
