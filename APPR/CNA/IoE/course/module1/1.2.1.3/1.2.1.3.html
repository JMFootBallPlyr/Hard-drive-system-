        <div>
          <p>The choice of motherboard and external components then influences the selection of the case and power supply.  The motherboard form factor must be matched with the correct type of computer case and power supply. For example, an ATX motherboard requires both an ATX-compatible case and power supply.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Cases often come with a power supply preinstalled. In this situation, you still need to verify that the power supply provides enough power to operate all the components that will be installed in the case.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>You can select a larger computer case to accommodate additional components that may be required in the future. Or you might select a smaller case that requires minimal space. In general, the computer case should be durable, easy to service, and have enough room for expansion. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Various factors affecting the choice of a computer case are described in Figure 1.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>A computer has many internal components that generate heat while the computer is running. Case fans should be installed to move cooler air into the computer case while moving heat out of the case. When choosing case fans, there are several factors to consider as described in Figure 2.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Note</b>: The direction of air flow created by all the fans in the case must work together to bring the cooler air in while moving the hotter air out. Installing a fan backwards or using fans with the incorrect size or speed for the case can cause the air flows to work against each other.</p>
