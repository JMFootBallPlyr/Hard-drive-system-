        <h1>Select the Power Supply</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Power supplies convert AC input to DC output voltages. Power supplies typically provide voltages of 3.3V, 5V, and 12V, and are measured in wattage. The power supply must provide enough power for the installed components and allow for other components that may be added at a later time. If you choose a power supply that powers only the current components, you might need to replace the power supply when other components are upgraded.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The table in the figure describes various factors to consider when selecting a power supply.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Be careful when connecting the power supply cables to other components. If you have a difficult time inserting a connector, try repositioning it, or check to make sure that no bent pins or foreign objects are in the way. If it is difficult to plug in a cable or other part, something is wrong. Cables, connectors, and components are designed to fit together snugly. Never force a connector or component. If a connector is plugged in incorrectly, it can damage the plug and the connector. Take your time and make sure that you are connecting the hardware correctly.</p>
