        <h1>Select Adapter Cards</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Adapter cards, also called expansion cards, are designed for a specific task and add extra functionality to a computer. Before purchasing an adapter card, consider the questions in Figure 1.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Note</b>: If the motherboard does not have a compatible expansion slot, an external device may be an option. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The following is a list of possible expansion cards that may be upgraded:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Graphics card</b> - The type of graphics card installed affects the overall performance of a computer. For example, a graphics card that needs to support intensive graphics could be RAM intensive, CPU intensive, or both. The computer must have the slots, RAM, and CPU to support the full functionality of an upgraded graphics card. Choose the graphics card based on current and future needs. For example, to play 3D games, the graphics card must meet or exceed the minimum requirements. Some GPUs are integrated into the CPU. When the GPU is integrated into the CPU, there is no need to purchase a graphics card unless advanced video features, such as 3D graphics, or very high resolution are required. Factors to consider when purchasing a new graphics card are listed in Figure 2.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Sound Cards</b> - The type of sound card installed determines the sound quality of your computer. A computer system must have quality speakers and a subwoofer to support the full functionality of an upgraded sound card. Choose the correct sound card based on your customer’s current and future needs. For example, if a customer wants to hear a specific type of surround sound, the sound card must have the correct hardware decoder to reproduce it. In addition, the customer can get improved sound accuracy with a sound card that has a higher sample rate. Factors to consider when purchasing a new sound card are listed in Figure 3.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Storage Controllers</b> - A storage controller is a chip that can be integrated into the motherboard or on an expansion card. Storage controllers allow for the expansion of internal and external drives for a computer system. Storage controllers, such as RAID controllers, can also provide fault tolerance or increased speed. The amount of data and the level of data protection needed for the customer influences the type of storage controller required. Choose the correct storage controller based on your customer’s current and future needs. For example, if a customer wants to implement RAID 5, a RAID storage controller with at least three drives is needed. Factors to consider when purchasing a new storage controller card are listed in Figure 4.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>I/O Cards</b> - Installing an I/O card in a computer is a fast and easy way to add I/O ports. USB are some of the most common ports to install on a computer. Choose the correct I/O card based on your customer’s current and future needs. For example, if a customer wants to add an internal card reader, and the motherboard has no internal USB connection, a USB I/O card with an internal USB connection is needed. Factors to consider when purchasing a new I/O card are listed in Figure 5.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>NICs</b> - Customers often upgrade a network interface card (NIC) to get faster speeds and more bandwidth. Factors to consider when purchasing a new network card are listed in Figure 6. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Capture Cards</b> - A capture card imports video into a computer and records it on a hard drive. The addition of a capture card with a television tuner allows you to view and record television programming. The computer system must have enough CPU power, adequate RAM, and a high-speed storage system to support the capture, recording, and editing demands of the customer. Choose the correct capture card based on your customer’s current and future needs. For example, if a customer wants to record one program while watching another, either multiple capture cards or a capture card with multiple TV tuners must be installed. Factors to consider when purchasing a new capture card are listed in Figure 7.</li>
