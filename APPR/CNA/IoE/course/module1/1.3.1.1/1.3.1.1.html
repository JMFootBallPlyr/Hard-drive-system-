          <p>Computers are sometimes referred to as:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Thick clients</b> –Sometimes called fat clients, these are standard computers that we have discussed in this chapter. The computers have their own operating system, multitude of applications, and local storage. They are stand-alone systems and do not require a network connection to operate. All of the processing is performed locally on the computer.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Thin clients</b> –These are typically low-end network computers that rely on remote servers to perform all data processing. Thin clients require a network connection to a server and usually access resources using a web browser. However, the client can be a computer running thin client software or a small, dedicated terminal consisting of a monitor, keyboard, and mouse. Typically the clients do not have any internal storage and have very little local resources. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>The table in the figure identifies differences between thick and thin clients.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Along with thick and thin clients, there are computers that are built for specific purposes. Part of the responsibilities of a computer technician is to evaluate, select appropriate components, and upgrade or custom-build specialized computers to meet the needs of customers.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>This section identifies and discusses some of these specialized computers.</p>
