        <h1>Open Source versus Closed Source</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Like desktops and laptops, mobile devices use an operating system (OS) to run software. This chapter focuses on the two most commonly used mobile operating systems: Android and iOS. Android is developed by Google, and iOS is developed by Apple.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Before users can analyze and modify software, they must be able to see the source code. Source code is the sequence of instructions that is written in human readable language, before it is turned into machine language (zeroes and ones). The source code is an important component of free software as it allows the users to analyze and eventually modify the code. When the developer chooses to provide the source code, the software is said to be open source. If the programâ€™s source code is not published, the software is said to be closed source.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Android is an open source OS developed by Google. iOS is a closed source OS developed by Apple.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Released in 2008 on the HTC Dream, the Android OS has been customized for use on a wide range of electronic devices. Because Android is open and customizable, programmers can use it to operate devices like laptops, smart TVs, and e-book readers. There have even been Android installations in devices like cameras, navigation systems, and portable media players. Figure 1 shows Android running on a tablet.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Released in 2007 on the first iPhone, the Apple iOS source code was not released to the public. To copy, modify or redistribute iOS requires permission from Apple. Figure 2 shows iOS running on an iPhone.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>This chapter focuses on Android 5.0.1 (Lollipop) and iOS 8.4 as these were the latest versions available at the time of writing.</p>
