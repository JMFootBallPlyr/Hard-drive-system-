        <h1>Mobile Application Development</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Mobile operating systems are not just stand alone products. Mobile operating systems are platforms on which other products can be created and marketed for use on that OS. Examples of such products are mobile applications, which are simply called apps. Apps are programs created to perform specific tasks on mobile devices. Calendars, maps, notes, and email are a few examples of apps commonly found in mobile devices.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>In the iOS ecosystem, apps were originally designed by Apple. Similarly, Google originally designed Android apps. When it became clear these operating systems were actually software platforms, Apple and Google each released their own Software Development Kit (SDK). An SDK contains a number of software tools designed to allow external programs to be written for a specific software package. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Developers who want to create Apple iOS apps must download and install Xcode, Apple's official integrated development environment (IDE). XCode, shown in Figure 1, can be downloaded at no cost and allows developers to write and test their iOS apps in an iPhone simulator. Loading and running apps on the actual iOS device requires the payment of a yearly iOS Developer Program subscription fee. Xcode also contains a debugger, libraries, a handset simulator, documentation, sample code and tutorials.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The Google Android SDK also includes many of the items listed above for Xcode, as well as a number of tutorials. The Android SDK supports several development platforms which include computers running Linux, Mac OS X 10.5.8 or later, and Windows XP or later. Android Studio is a Google IDE for Android development.</p>
