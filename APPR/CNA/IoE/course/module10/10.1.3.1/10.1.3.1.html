        <h1>Home Screen Items</h1>
        <div>
          <p>The iOS interface works in much the same way as the Android interface. Screens are used to organize apps, and apps are launched with a touch. There are some very important differences:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>No navigation icons</b> - A physical button must be pressed instead of touching navigation icons. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>No widgets</b> - Only apps and other content can be installed on iOS device screens.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>No app shortcuts</b> - Each app on a home screen is the actual app, not a shortcut.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Home Button</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Unlike Android, iOS devices do not use navigation icons to perform functions. A single physical button called the Home button performs many of the same functions as the Android navigation buttons. The Home button is at the bottom of the device, as shown in Figure 1. The Home button performs the following functions:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Wake the device</b> - When the device’s screen is off, press the Home button once to turn it on.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Return to the home screen</b> - Press the Home button while using an app to return to the last home screen that was used.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Open the multitasking bar</b> - Double-press the Home button to open the multitasking bar. The multitasking bar shows the most recent apps that have been used.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Start Siri or voice control</b> – Press and hold the Home button to start Siri or voice control. Siri is special software that understands advanced voice controls. On devices without Siri, basic voice controls can be accessed in the same way.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Open audio controls</b> - Double-press the Home button when the screen is locked to open the audio controls.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Notification Center</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>iOS devices have a notification center that displays all alerts in one location, as shown in Figure 2. To open the notification area on iOS devices, touch the top of the screen and swipe a finger down the screen. The following actions can be taken when notifications are open:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Respond to an alert by touching it.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Remove an alert by touching the X icon and touching clear.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>To change the options for notifications on a per-app basis, use the following path: </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Settings > Notifications</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Commonly Used Settings</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>iOS devices allow the user to quickly access common settings and switches, even if the device is locked. To access the commonly used settings menu, swipe up from the very bottom of any screen, as shown in Figure 3. From the commonly used settings screen a user can:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Toggle often used settings such as airplane mode, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, do not disturb mode and screen rotation lock</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Adjust screen brightness</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Control the music player</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Access Airdrop</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Access Flashlight, Clock, Calendar and Camera</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Spotlight (Search tool)</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>From any screen of an iOS device, touch the screen and drag down to reveal the Spotlight search field. Any part of the screen except the very top or the very bottom should work. When Spotlight search field is revealed, type what you're looking for. Spotlight shows suggestions from many sources including the Internet, iTunes, App Store, movie show times, locations nearby. Spotlight also automatically updates the results as you type, as shown in Figure 4.</p>
