        <div>
          <p>
            <b>Apps</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>iOS apps and folders work similarly to the Android OS. Instead of an All Apps button, all the apps that are installed on the device are located on the home screens. Apps can be uninstalled from the device, but can be re-installed on the device using iTunes. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Each home screen has a grid in which apps can be placed. To move an app, follow these steps:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 1.</b> Touch and hold the app until it jiggles.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 2.</b> Drag it to an empty area of any home screen.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 3.</b> Release the app.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 4.</b> Move any additional apps.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 5.</b> Press the Home button to save the changes.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>To remove an app from an iOS device, follow these steps:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 1.</b> Touch and hold the app until it jiggles.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 2.</b> Touch the X icon on the app.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 3.</b> Delete any additional apps.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 4.</b> Press the Home button to save the changes.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Multitasking Bar</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>iOS allows multiple apps to run at the same time. While you are working in one app, others may run in the background. The multitasking bar is used to quickly switch between the apps that have been used recently, close apps that are running, and access commonly used settings. To open the multitasking bar, as shown in Figure 1, double-click the Home button. While the multitask bar is visible, iOS will also show favorite and recent contacts on the top of the screen. The following actions can be performed in the multitasking bar:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Touch any app to open it.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Swipe the multitasking bar to the right or to the left to see more apps.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Tap on any favorite or recent contact on the top of screen to access it.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Swipe an app up to force the app to close.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Folders</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Folders can also be created on iOS devices to help organize them. To create a folder, follow these steps:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 1.</b> Touch and hold an app on a home screen until it jiggles.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 2.</b> Drag the app onto another app that you want to put in the same folder.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 3.</b> Release the app.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 4.</b> Add any additional apps to the folder.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 5.</b> Touch the Home button to save changes.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Touch any folder to open it. Touch any app in the folder to open it. To rename a folder, touch the folder, touch the folder name, and type a new name for the folder. To close a folder, touch outside the folder or touch the Home button. Move folders around on home screens the same way apps are moved.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>To remove an app from a folder, follow these steps:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 1.</b> Open the folder.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 2.</b> Touch and hold the app you want to remove.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 3.</b> Drag the app to an empty area of a home screen.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 4.</b> Release the app.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>To remove a folder, remove all apps from the folder.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Many of the apps on iOS devices are able to show an alert badge. An alert badge is displayed as a small icon over an app, as shown in Figure 2. This icon is a number that indicates the amount of alerts from the app. This number might be how many missed calls you have, how many text messages that you have, or how many updates are available. If an alert badge displays an exclamation mark, there is a problem with the app. Alert badges for apps inside a folder are displayed on the folder. Touch the app to attend to the alerts.</p>
