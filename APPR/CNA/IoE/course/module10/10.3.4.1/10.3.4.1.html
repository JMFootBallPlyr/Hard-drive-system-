        <h1>Types of Data to Synchronize</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Many people use a combination of desktop, laptop, tablet, and smartphone devices to access and store information. It is helpful when specific information is the same across multiple devices. For example, when scheduling appointments using a calendar program, each new appointment would need to be entered in each device to ensure that each device is up to date. Data synchronization eliminates the need to make changes to every device.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Data synchronization is the exchange of data between two or more devices, while maintaining consistent data on those devices. These are some of the types of data that can be synchronized:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Contacts</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Email</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Calendar entries</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Pictures</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Music</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Apps</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Video</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Browser links and settings</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>Although the term Sync means data synchronization in the sense covered above, it has slight differences on Android and iOS.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Android</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Sync essentially synchronizes your contacts and other data with Google and other services.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The Sync process on Android synchronizes user data to services, including Facebook, Google and Ubuntu One. As a result, all devices associated to that Google account have access to the same data, making it easier to replace a damaged device without data loss. The synchronizing process on Android is also simple; just add the account and turn on Auto Sync.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>You may see all accounts on your device by visiting <b>Settings > Accounts</b>, as shown in Figure 1. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Auto-sync will synchronize your device with the service's servers automatically, without user intervention. To turn on Auto-Sync, from the same Accounts panel shown in Figure 1, select the triple dot icon on the upper right corner and tap <b>Auto-sync data</b>.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Android Sync also allows the user to choose what types of data gets synchronized. To turn on or off data sync per-data type on Android, use the following path:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Settings > Accounts ></b> tap on the account you want to configure <b>></b> toggle the data types on or off accordingly, as shown in Figure 2.</p>
          <p>
            <b>iOS</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Two different processes exist on iOS to synchronize device data. They are Backup and Sync. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Backup copies your personal data from your phone to your computer. That includes application settings, text messages, voicemails, and other data types.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Sync copies new apps, music, video, or books from iTunes to your phone and from your phone to iTunes, resulting on full synchronization on both devices.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Backup saves a copy of the all data created by the user and by apps. Sync copies only media downloaded via the iTunes Store mobile app, respecting what was specified through iTunes' Sync definitions. For example, a user can keep movies from syncing to the phone if the user does not watch movies on the phone.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>As a general rule, when connecting an iOS device to iTunes, always perform a Backup first, and then Sync. This order can be changed in iTunes' Preferences.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>A few more useful options are available when performing Sync or Backup on iOS:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Backup storage location -</b> iTunes allows backups to be stored on the local computer hard drive or on the iCloud online service.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Backup straight from iOS device -</b> In addition to backing up data from an iOS device to the local hard drive or iCloud through iTunes, users can configure the iOS device to upload a copy of its data directly to iCloud. This is useful as Backups can be performed automatically, eliminating the need to connect to iTunes. Similar to Android, the user can also specify what type of data is sent to the iCloud backup, as shown in Figure 3.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Sync over Wi-Fi - </b>iTunes can scan and connect to iOS on the same Wi-Fi network. When connected, the Backup process can be initiated automatically between iOS devices and iTunes. This is useful as Backups can be performed automatically every time iTunes and the iOS device are on the same Wi-Fi, eliminating the need for a wired USB connection.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>When a new iPhone is connected to the computer, iTunes will offer to restore it using the most recent backup of data from other iOS devices, if available. Figure 4 shows the iTunes window on a computer.</p>
