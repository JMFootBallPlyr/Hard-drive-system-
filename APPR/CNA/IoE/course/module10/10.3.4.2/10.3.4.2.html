        <h1>Synchronization Connection Types</h1>
        <div>
          <p>To synchronize data between devices, the devices must use a common communication medium. USB and Wi-Fi connections are the most common connection types used to synchronize data between devices.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Because most Android devices do not have a desktop program for performing data synchronization, most users sync with Googleâ€™s different web services, even when synchronizing with a desktop or laptop computer. One benefit of synchronizing data using this method is that the data is accessible from any computer or mobile device at any time by signing in to a Google account. The disadvantage to this arrangement is that it can be difficult to synchronize data with programs that are installed locally on a computer, such as Outlook for email, calendar, and contacts. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Before iOS 5, synchronization was limited to using a USB connection cable to connect the device to a computer. You can now use Wi-Fi Sync to synchronize with iTunes. To use Wi-Fi Sync, you must first synchronize the iOS device with iTunes using a USB cable. You must also turn on Sync over Wi-Fi Connection in the Summary pane of iTunes. After that, you can use Wi-Fi Sync or a USB cable. When the iOS device is on the same wireless network as the computer running iTunes and it is plugged into a power source, it automatically synchronizes with iTunes.</p>
