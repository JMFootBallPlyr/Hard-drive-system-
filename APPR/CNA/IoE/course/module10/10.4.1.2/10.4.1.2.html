        <h1>Overview of Linux and OS X GUI</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Most operating systems include one or more GUI component to facilitate the user-computer interaction. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Linux GUI</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Different Linux distributions ship with different software packages, but users decide what stays in their system by installing or removing packages. The graphical interface in Linux is comprised of a number of subsystems that can also be removed or replaced by the user. While the details about these subsystems and their interactions are beyond the scope of this course, it is important to know the Linux GUI as whole can be easily replaced by the user. As a result of the extremely large number of Linux distributions, this chapter focuses on Ubuntu when covering Linux.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Ubuntu Linux uses Unity as its default GUI. Figure 1 shows a breakdown of the main components of Ubuntu Unity Desktop. Another feature in the Linux GUI is the ability to have multiple desktops or workspaces. This allows the users to arrange the windows on a particular workspace.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Canonical has a website that simulates Unity’s UI and also provides a tour through the Unity’s main features. To experience Unity via Canonical’s website visit <a href="http://tour.ubuntu.com/en/" target="_blank">http://tour.ubuntu.com/en/</a>. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>OS X GUI</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Among the major differences between older versions of Mac OS and OS X is the addition of the Aqua GUI. Aqua was designed around the theme of water, with components resembling droplets and a deliberate use of reflection and translucency. The latest release of OS X 10.10 Yosemite introduces a flatter Aqua theme. Figure 2 shows a breakdown of the OS X Aqua desktop.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>With OS X, Mission Control is a quick way to see everything that is currently open on your Mac. Mission Control can be accessed by using a three or four finger swipe up gesture, depending on your touch pad or mouse settings. Mission Control allows you to organize your apps on multiple desktops.</p>
