        <h1>Identify the Problem</h1>
        <div>
          <p>When troubleshooting problems with mobile devices, find out if the device is under warranty. If it is, it can often be returned to the place of purchase for an exchange. If the device in no longer under warranty, determine if a repair is cost-effective. To determine the best course of action, compare the cost of the repair with the replacement cost of the mobile device. Because many mobile devices change rapidly in design and functionality, they are often more expensive to repair than to replace. For this reason, mobile devices are usually replaced.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Follow the steps outlined in this section to accurately identify, repair, and document the problem.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Mobile device problems can result from a combination of hardware, software, and network issues. Mobile technicians must be able to analyze the problem and determine the cause of the error to repair the mobile device. This process is called troubleshooting. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The first step in the troubleshooting process is to identify the problem. The figures show a list of open-ended and closed-ended questions to ask the customer. Figure 1 focuses on mobile device operating systems while Figure 2 focuses on Linux and OS X.</p>
