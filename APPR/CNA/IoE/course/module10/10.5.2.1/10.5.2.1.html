        <h1>Identify Common Problems and Solutions</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Computer problems can be attributed to hardware, software, networks, or some combination of the three. You will resolve some types of computer problems more often than others. Figure 1 is a chart of common mobile device problems and solutions while Figure 2 is chart of common PC problems and solutions.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Many computer problems can be solved by simply turning off the device and turning it back on. When a mobile device does not respond to a reboot, a reset may need to be performed. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>These are some of the ways that Android devices can be reset, check the documentation for your mobile device to determine how to reset your device:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Hold down the power button until the mobile device turns off. Turn the device on again.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Hold down the power button and the volume down button until the mobile device turns off. Turn the device on again.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>This is how iOS devices can be reset:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Press and hold both the Sleep/Wake button and the Home button for 10 seconds, until the Apple logo appears.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>In some cases, when a standard reset does not correct the problem, a factory reset may need to be performed. To perform a factory reset on an Android device, use the following path:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Settings > Backup and reset > Factory data reset > Reset device</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>To perform a factory reset on an iOS device, use the following path:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Settings > General > Reset > Erase All Content and Settings</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>CAUTION</b>: A factory reset restores the device to the state when it left the factory. All settings and user data is deleted from the device when a factory reset is performed. Be sure to back up any data and record any settings before performing a factory reset because all data and settings will be lost after performing a factory reset.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>When a reboot does not fix a PC, more investigation should be done. You may find that some configuration should be changed, software updates are required or a misbehaving program is the culprit and must be reinstalled.</p>
