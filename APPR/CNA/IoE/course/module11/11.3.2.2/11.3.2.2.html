        <h1>Software Print Servers</h1>
        <div>
          <p>In a previous topic, you learned how a Windows computer can share an attached printer with other Windows computers on the network. But what if the computer sharing the printer is running a different operating system, such as Mac OS X?  In such a situation, you can use print server software.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>One example is Appleâ€™s free Bonjour Printer Server, which is a built-in service in Mac OS X. It is automatically installed on a Windows computer if you install the Apple Safari Browser. You can also download the Bonjour Printer Server for Windows for free from the Apple website. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Once downloaded and installed, the Bonjour Printer Server operates in the background, automatically detecting any compatible printers connected to the network. Open the Bonjour Printer Wizard to configure the Windows computer to use a printer, as shown in the figure.  </p>
          <p>Sharing a printer from a computer also has disadvantages. The computer sharing the printer uses its own resources to manage the print jobs coming to the printer. If the computer user on the desktop is working at the same time as a user on the network is printing, the desktop computer user might notice a performance slowdown. In addition, the printer is not available to others if the user reboots or powers off the computer with a shared printer.</p>
