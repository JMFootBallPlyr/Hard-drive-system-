        <h1>What is a Security Policy?</h1>
        <div>
          <p>A security policy is a set of security objectives that ensure the security of a network, the data, and the computer systems in an organization. The security policy is a constantly evolving document based on changes in technology, business, and employee requirements.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The security policy is usually created and managed by the organization management and the IT staff as illustrated in Figure 1. Together they create a document that should answer the questions listed in Figure 2.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>A security policy typically includes the items described in Figure 3. This list is not exhaustive and could include other items related specifically to the operation of an organization.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>In this course, we focus on configuring the Local Security Policy in Windows.</p>
