        <h1>InPrivate Browsing</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Web browsers retain information about the web pages that you visit, the searches that you perform, and other identifiable information including usernames, passwords, and more. This is a convenient feature when using a computer at home that is secured with a password.  However, this is a concern when using a public computer such as a computer in a library, hotel business center, or an Internet caf√©. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The information retained by web browsers can be recovered and exploited by others. They could use the information to steal your identity, steal your money, or change your passwords on important accounts.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>To improve security when using a public computer, web browsers provide the ability to browse the web anonymously without retaining information. For instance, the InPrivate Browsing feature in Internet Explorer 11 prevents the storing of the information displayed in Figure 1. While browsing, the InPrivate Browser temporarily stores files and cookies and deletes them when the InPrivate session is ended.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>An InPrivate Browsing window can be opened from the Windows desktop or from within the browser. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>To start InPrivate Browsing in Windows 7, right-click the <b>Internet Explorer </b>icon as shown in Figure 2, then click<b> Start InPrivate Browsing</b>. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>This opens a new InPrivate Browser window shown in Figure 3. The window explains the InPrivate feature and confirms that the feature is enabled. Also notice that the address bar now identifies this as an InPrivate window as highlighted in the figure. Closing the browser window ends the InPrivate Browsing session. It is important to note that only this browser window and any new tabs opened within this window provide privacy. Other opened browser windows are not protected by InPrivate Browsing. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>To open an InPrivate Browsing window from within Internet Explorer 11, use the following path as shown in Figure 4:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Tools > InPrivate Browsing</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>As an alternative, you could press <b>Ctrl+Shift+P </b>to open an InPrivate window.</p>
