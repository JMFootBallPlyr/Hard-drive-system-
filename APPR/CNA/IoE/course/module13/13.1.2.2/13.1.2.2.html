        <h1>Displaying Professional Behavior with Customers</h1>
        <div>
          <p>When dealing with customers, it is necessary to be professional in all aspects of your role. You must handle customers with respect and prompt attention. When on a telephone, make sure that you know how to place a customer on hold, as well as how to transfer a customer without losing the call. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Be positive when communicating with the customer. Tell the customer what you can do. Do not focus on what you cannot do. Be prepared to explain alternative ways that you can help them, such as emailing information and step-by-step instructions, or using remote control software to solve the problem. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Figure 1 outlines the process to follow before you put a customer on hold. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Figure 2 outlines the process for transferring a call. It is similar to placing a call on hold, with a few differences. When dealing with customers, it is sometimes easier to explain what you should not do. The following list describes things that you should not do when talking with a customer:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Do not minimize a customerâ€™s problems. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Do not use jargon, abbreviations, acronyms, and slang. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Do not use a negative attitude or tone of voice. </li>

          <p>
            <ul>
