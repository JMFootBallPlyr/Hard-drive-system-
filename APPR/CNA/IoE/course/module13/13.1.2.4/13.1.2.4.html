        <h1>Keeping the Customer Focused on the Problem</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Part of your job is to focus the customer during the phone call. When you focus the customer on the problem, it allows you to control the call. This makes the best use of your time and the customerâ€™s time. Do not take any comments personally, and do not retaliate with any comments or criticism. If you stay calm with the customer, finding a solution to the problem will remain the focal point of the call.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Just as there are many different computer problems, there are many different types of customers. The figure shows strategies for dealing with different types of difficult customers. The list of difficult customer types below is not comprehensive. Often a customer will display a combination of traits. Try to recognize which traits your customer exhibits. Recognizing these traits can help you manage the call accordingly.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Talkative Customers</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>During the call, a talkative customer discusses everything except the problem. The customer often uses the call as an opportunity to socialize. It can be difficult to get a talkative customer to focus on the problem but it is possible using the tips shown in the figure.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Rude Customers</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>A rude customer complains during the call and often makes negative comments about the product, the service, and the technician. This type of customer is sometimes abusive and uncooperative and gets aggravated very easily.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Angry Customers</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>An angry customer talks loudly and often tries to speak when the technician is talking. Angry customers are usually frustrated that they have a problem and upset that they have to call somebody to fix it.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Knowledgeable Customers</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>A knowledgeable customer wants to speak with a technician who is equally experienced in computers. This type of customer usually tries to control the call and does not want to speak with a level one technician. </p>
          <p>
            <b>Inexperienced Customers</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>An inexperienced customer has difficulty describing the problem. These customers are sometimes not able to follow directions correctly and not able to communicate the errors that they encounter. </p>
