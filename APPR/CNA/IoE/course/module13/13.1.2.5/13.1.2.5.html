        <h1>Using Proper Netiquette</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Have you read an online forum where two or three members have stopped discussing the issue and have begun to insult each other?  Have you ever wondered if they would actually say those things to each other in person? Perhaps you have received an email that had no greeting or was written entirely in capital letters. How did this make you feel while you were reading it? </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>As a technician, you should be professional in all communications with customers. For email and text communications, there is a set of personal and business etiquette rules called Netiquette. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>In addition to email and text Netiquette, there are general rules that apply to all your online interactions with customers and co-workers:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Respect other people’s time.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Share expert knowledge. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Respect other people’s privacy. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Be forgiving of other people’s mistakes. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
