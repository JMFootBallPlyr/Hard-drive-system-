        <h1>Observing Service Level Agreements</h1>
        <div>
          <p>When dealing with customers, it is important to adhere to that customer’s service level agreement (SLA). An SLA is a contract that defines expectations between an organization and the service vendor to provide an agreed-upon level of support. As an employee of the service company, your job is to honor the SLA that you have with the customer. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>An SLA is typically a legal agreement that contains the responsibilities and liabilities of all parties involved. Some of the contents of an SLA usually include the following:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Response time guarantees (often based on type of call and level of service agreement) </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Equipment and software that is supported </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Where service is provided </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Preventive maintenance </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Diagnostics </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Part availability (equivalent parts) </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Cost and penalties </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Time of service availability (for example, 24x7 or Monday to Friday, 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. EST) </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>Occasionally, there might be exceptions to the SLA. Some exceptions might include a customer’s option to upgrade the level of service or to escalate a problem to management for review. Escalation to management should be reserved for special situations. For example, a long-standing customer or a customer from a large company might have a problem that falls outside the parameters stated in their SLA. In these cases, management might choose to support the customer for customer-relation reasons.</p>
