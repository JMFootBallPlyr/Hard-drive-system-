        <h1>Ethical Considerations in IT</h1>
        <div>
          <p>When you are working with customers and their equipment, there are some general ethical customs and legal rules that you should observe. These customs and rules often overlap.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>You should always have respect for your customers, as well as for their property. Computers and monitors are property, but property also includes any information or data that might be accessible, for example:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Emails </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Phone lists </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Records or data on the computer </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Hard copies of files, information, or data left on a desk </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>Before accessing computer accounts, including the administrator account, get the permission of the customer. From the troubleshooting process, you might have gathered some private information, such as usernames and passwords. If you document this type of private information, you must keep it confidential. Divulging customer information to anyone else is not only unethical, but might be illegal. Legal details of customer information are usually covered under the SLA.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Take particular care to keep personally identifiable information (PII) confidential. PII is any data that could potentially identify a specific individual. <a href="http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-122/sp800-122.pdf" target="_blank">NIST Special Publication 800-122</a> defines PII as, “any information about an individual maintained by an agency, including (1) any information that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual‘s identity, such as name, social security number, date and place of birth, mother‘s maiden name, or biometric records; and (2) any other information that is linked or linkable to an individual, such as medical, educational, financial, and employment information”.</p>
          <p>Examples of PII include, but are not limited to:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Name, such as full name, maiden name, mother‘s maiden name, or alias</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Personal identification numbers, such as social security number (SSN), passport number, driver‘s license number, taxpayer identification number, or financial account or credit card number </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Address information, such as street address or email address </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Personal characteristics, including photographic image (especially of face or other identifying characteristic), fingerprints, handwriting, or other biometric data (e.g., retina scan, voice signature, facial geometry)</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>Do not send unsolicited messages to a customer. Do not send unsolicited mass mailings or chain letters to customers. Never send forged or anonymous emails. All these activities are considered unethical and, in certain circumstances, might be considered illegal. </p>
