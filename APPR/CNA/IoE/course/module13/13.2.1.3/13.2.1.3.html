        <h1>Licensing</h1>
        <div>
          <p>As an IT technician, you may encounter customers who are using software illegally. It is important that you understand the purpose and types of common software licenses, should you determine that a crime has been committed. Your responsibilities are usually covered in your company’s corporate end-user policy. In all instances, you must follow security best practices, including documentation and chain of custody procedures. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>A software license is a contract that outlines the legal use, or redistribution, of that software. Most software licenses grant an end-user permission to use one or more copies of software. They also specify the end-user’s rights and restrictions. This ensures that the software owner’s copyright is maintained. It is illegal to use licensed software without the appropriate license.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Personal License</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Most software is licensed rather than sold. Some types of personal software licenses regulate how many computers can run a copy of the software. Other licenses specify the number of users that can access the software. Most personal software licenses allow you to run the program on only one machine. There are personal software licenses that allow you to copy the software onto multiple computers. These licenses usually specify that the copies cannot be used at the same time.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>One example of a personal software license is an End User License Agreement (EULA). A EULA is a license between the software owner and an individual end-user. The end-user must agree to accept the terms of the EULA. Sometimes, accepting a EULA is as simple as opening the physical package that holds a CD of the software, or by downloading and installing the software. A common example of agreeing to a EULA occurs when updating software on tablets and smartphones. The end-user must agree to accept the EULA when updating the operating system, or installing or updating software found on the device, by clicking “I accept the license terms”, as shown in the figure.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The end-user can decline a EULA by returning the unopened software package, or by clicking "I do not accept" when prompted.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Enterprise License</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>An enterprise license is a software site license held by a company. Typically with an enterprise license, the company pays for its employees to use the software. This software does not need to be registered every time it is installed on another employee’s computer. In some cases, the employees may need to use a password to activate each copy of the license.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Open Source Licenses and Commercial Licenses</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Open source licensing is copyright license for software that allows developers to modify and share the source code that runs the software.  In some cases, an open source license means that the software is free to all users. In other cases, it means that the software can be purchased. In both instances, users have access to the source code. Some examples of open source software are Linux, WordPress, and Firefox.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>If software is being used by an individual who is not using it to make money, that person would have a personal license for that software.  Personal software licenses are often free or low-cost. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>If a person uses software to make money, that person would pay a commercial license.  Commercial software licenses are usually more expensive than personal licenses. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Digital Rights Management</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>In addition to licensing, there is also software that helps to control illegal use of software and content.  Digital rights management (DRM) is software that is designed to prevent illegal access to digital content and devices.  DRM is used by hardware and software manufacturers, publishers, copyright holders, and individuals. Their purpose for using DRM is to prevent copyrighted content from being copied freely. This helps the copyright holder to maintain control of the content and to be paid for access to that content.</p>
