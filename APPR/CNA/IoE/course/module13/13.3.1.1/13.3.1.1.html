        <h1>Call Centers</h1>
        <div>
          <p>A call center environment is usually very professional and fast-paced. Customers call in to receive help for a specific computer-related problem. The typical workflow of a call center is that calls from customers are displayed on a callboard. Level one technicians answer these calls in the order that the calls arrive. If the level one technician cannot solve the problem, it is escalated to a level two technician. In all instances, the technician must supply the level of support that is outlined in the customer’s SLA. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>A call center might exist within a company and offer service to the employees of that company as well as to the customers of that company’s products. Alternatively, a call center might be an independent business that sells computer support as a service to outside customers. In either case, a call center is a busy, fast-paced work environment, often operating 24 hours a day.</p>
          <p>Call centers tend to have a large number of cubicles. As shown in Figure 1, each cubicle has a chair, at least one computer, a phone, and a headset. The technicians working at these cubicles have varied levels of experience in computers, and some have specialties in certain types of computers, hardware, software, or operating systems. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>All the computers in a call center have support software. The technicians use this software to manage many of their job functions. Figure 2 shows some of the features of support software.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Each call center has business policies regarding call priority. Figure 3 provides a sample chart of how calls can be named, defined, and prioritized.</p>
