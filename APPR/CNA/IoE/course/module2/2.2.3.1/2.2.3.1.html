        <h1>Reference Tools</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Good customer service includes providing the customer with a detailed description of the problem and the solution. It is important that a technician document all services and repairs and that this documentation is available to all other technicians. The documentation can then be used as reference material for similar problems. </p>
          <p>
            <b>Personal Reference Tools</b>
          </p>
          <p>Personal reference tools include troubleshooting guides, manufacturer manuals, quick reference guides, and repair journals. In addition to an invoice, a technician keeps a journal of upgrades and repairs: </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Notes </b>- Make notes as you go through the troubleshooting and repair process. Refer to these notes to avoid repeating steps and to determine what needs to be done next. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Journal </b>- Include descriptions of the problem, possible solutions that have been tried to correct the problem, and the steps taken to repair the problem. Note any configuration changes made to the equipment and any replacement parts used in the repair. Your journal, along with your notes, can be valuable when you encounter similar situations in the future. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>History of repairs </b>- Make a detailed list of problems and repairs, including the date, replacement parts, and customer information. The history allows a technician to determine what work has been performed on a specific computer in the past. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
