        <h1>Hand Tools</h1>
        <div>
          <p>A technician needs to be able to properly use each tool in the toolkit. This page covers many of the various hand tools used when repairing computers.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Screws</b>
          </p>
          <p>Match each screw with the proper screwdriver. Place the tip of the screwdriver on the head of the screw. Turn the screwdriver clockwise to tighten the screw and counter clockwise to loosen the screw, as shown in Figure 1.</p>
          <p>Screws can become stripped if you do not use the correct size and type of screwdriver. A stripped screw may not tighten firmly or it may not be easily removed. Discard stripped screws.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Flat Head Screwdriver</b>
          </p>
          <p>As shown in Figure 2, use a flat head screwdriver when you are working with a slotted screw. Do not use a flat head screwdriver to remove a Phillips head screw. Never use a screwdriver as a pry bar. If you cannot remove a component, check to see if there is a clip or latch that is securing the component in place.</p>
          <p>
            <b>CAUTION:</b> If excessive force is needed to remove or add a component, something is probably wrong. Take a second look to make sure that you have not missed a screw or a locking clip that is holding the component in place. Refer to the device manual or diagram for additional information.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Phillips Head Screwdriver</b>
          </p>
          <p>As shown in Figure 3, use a Phillips head screwdriver with crosshead screws. Do not use this type of screwdriver to puncture anything. This will damage the head of the screwdriver. </p>
          <p>
            <b>Hex Driver</b>
          </p>
          <p>Use a hex driver to loosen and tighten bolts that have a hexagonal (six-sided) head. Hex bolts should not be over-tightened because the threads of the bolts can be damaged. Do not use a hex driver that is too large for the bolt that you are using.</p>
          <p>
            <b>CAUTION:</b> Some tools are magnetized. When working around electronic devices, be sure that the tools you are using have not been magnetized. Magnetic fields can be harmful to data stored on magnetic media. Magnetic tools can also induce current, which can damage internal computer components. Test your tool by touching the tool with a screw. If the screw is attracted to the tool, do not use the tool.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Component Retrieving Tools</b>
          </p>
          <p>As shown in Figure 4, a parts retriever is used to place and retrieve parts that may be hard to reach with your fingers. Do not scratch or hit any components when using these tools. </p>
          <p>
            <b>CAUTION:</b> Pencils should not be used inside the computer to change the setting of switches. The pencil lead can act as a conductor and may damage the computer components.</p>
          <p>Various specialty tools, such as Torx bits, antistatic bags and gloves, and integrated circuit pullers, can be used to repair and maintain computers. Always avoid magnetized tools, such as screwdrivers with magnetic heads, or tools that use extension magnets to retrieve small metal objects that are out of reach. Additionally, there are specialized testing devices used to diagnose computer and cable problems:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Multimeter</b> - A device that measures AC/DC voltage, electric current, and other electrical characteristics, as shown in Figure 5. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Power supply tester</b> - A device that checks whether the computer power supply is working properly. A simple power supply tester might just have indicator lights, while more advanced versions show the amount of voltage and amperage. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Cable tester</b> - A device that checks for wiring shorts, faults, or wires connected to the wrong pins. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Loopback plug</b> - A device that connects to a computer, switch, or router port to perform a diagnostic procedure called a loopback test. In a loopback test, a signal is transmitted through a circuit and then returned to the sending device to test the integrity of the data transmission. </li>
            </ul>
