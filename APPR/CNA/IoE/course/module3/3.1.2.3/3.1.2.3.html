        <h1>Install RAM</h1>
        <div>
          <p>RAM provides fast, temporary data storage for the CPU while the computer is operating. RAM is volatile memory, which means that its contents are lost every time the computer is powered off. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>RAM may be installed on the motherboard before the motherboard is installed in the computer case. Before installation, consult the motherboard documentation or website of the motherboard manufacturer to ensure that the RAM is compatible with the motherboard.</p>
          <p>Like the CPU, RAM is also highly sensitive to ESD. Therefore, always work on an antistatic mat and wear a wrist strap or antistatic gloves when installing and removing RAM. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>To install RAM on the motherboard, follow these steps:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 1. </b>(Figure 1) Open the locking tabs on the DIMM slot.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 2.</b> (Figure 2) Align the notches on the RAM module to the keys in the slot and firmly press straight down. </p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 3.</b> (Figure 3) Ensure that the locking tabs click into place. </p>
          <p>
            <b>CAUTION</b>: RAM can be damaged and also cause serious damage to the motherboard if it is incorrectly aligned when the computer is powered on.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 4. </b>Make sure each memory module is completely inserted into the socket and that the locking tabs have secured the RAM module.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 5. </b>Visually check for exposed contacts. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Installation Tip</b>: When a RAM module is pressed into the slot correctly, a click will be heard and felt as the locking tab moves into place.</p>
