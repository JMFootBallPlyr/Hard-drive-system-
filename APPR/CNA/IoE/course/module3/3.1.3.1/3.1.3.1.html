        <h1>Install the Hard Drive</h1>
        <div>
          <p>A computer case holds drives in drive bays. The table in Figure 1 describes the three most common types of drive bays. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>To install an HDD, find an empty hard drive bay in the case that will accommodate the width of the drive. Smaller drives can often be installed in wider drive bays using special trays or adapters.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>To install a 3.5 in (8.9 cm) HDD into a 3.5 in drive bay, follow these steps:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 1. </b>Position the HDD so that it aligns with the drive bay opening.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 2. </b>Insert the HDD into the drive bay so that the screw holes in the drive line up with the screw holes in the case, as shown in Figure 2.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 3. </b>Secure the HDD to the case using the proper screws as shown in Figure 3.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>When installing multiple drives in a case, it is recommended to maintain some space between the drives to help airflow and enhance cooling. Also, mount the drive with the metal side face up. This metal face helps to dissipate heat from the hard drive.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Installation Tip</b>: Slightly hand-tighten all the screws before tightening any of them with a screw driver. This will make it easier to tighten the last two screws.</p>
