        <h1>Processor Architecture</h1>
        <div>
          <p>The processor architecture of the central processing unit (CPU) affects the performance of the computer. A CPU contains a register, which is a storage location, where logical functions are performed on the data. A larger register can point to more addresses than a smaller register.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>To better understand CPU architecture, use the analogy of a cook. He has a tool and some food in his hands. Think of his hands as a register. If the cook has very large hands, he can hold more items to be used immediately. On the counter (cache), he has other tools and ingredients that he will be using very soon, but is not using at this moment. In the kitchen (main memory) are ingredients and tools that are needed for the dish, but not as soon as the items on the counter will be needed. Other tools and ingredients related to cooking are in the stores around town (hard drive). These items can be ordered and shipped into his kitchen, if they are needed.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The terms 32-bit and 64-bit refer to the amount of data a computer's CPU can manage. A 32-bit register can store 2^32 different binary values. Therefore, a 32-bit processor can directly address 4,294,967,295 bytes. A 64-bit register can store 2^64 different binary values. Therefore, a 64-bit can directly address 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 bytes.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The figure shows the main differences between the 32-bit and 64-bit architectures.</p>
