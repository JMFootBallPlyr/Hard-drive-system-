        <h1>Disk Cloning</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Installing an OS on a single computer takes time. Imagine the time it would take to install operating systems on multiple computers, one at a time. To simplify this activity, administrators usually elect a computer to act as base system and go through the regular operating system installation process. After the operating is installed in the base computer, a specific program is used to copy all the information in its disk, sector by sector, to another disk. This new disk, usually an external device, now contains a fully deployed operating system and can be used to quickly deploy a fresh installed copy of the base operating system. Because the target disk now contains a sector-to-sector mapping of the original disk, the contents of the target disk is an image of the original disk.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>If an undesirable setting is accidentally included during the base installation, an administrator can use Microsoftâ€™s System Preparation (Sysprep) tool to remove it before creating the final image. Sysprep can be used to install and configure the same OS on multiple computers. Sysprep prepares the OS with different hardware configurations. With Sysprep, technicians can quickly install the OS, complete the last configuration steps, and install applications.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Figure 1 shows Sysprep in Windows 8.1 and Windows 8. Figure 2 shows Sysprep in Windows 7 and Windows Vista.</p>
