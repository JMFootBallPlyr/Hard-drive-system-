        <h1>Windows Desktop</h1>
        <div>
          <p>After the OS has been installed, you can customize the computer desktop to suit individual needs. A computer desktop is a graphical representation of the workspace and is commonly called a graphical user interface, or GUI. The desktop has icons, toolbars, and menus to manipulate files. You can add or change images, sounds, and colors to provide a more personalized look and feel. Together, these customizable items make up a theme. Figure 1 shows a Windows 8 desktop environment.</p>
          <p>Windows 8 introduced a new desktop that uses tiles on the Start screen, as shown Figure 2. This environment is used on desktops and laptops and it is optimized for mobile devices. The Start screen displays a customizable array of tiles designed to access apps and other information, such as social media updates and calendar notifications. These tiles represent notifications, applications or desktop programs. The tiles that can display dynamic content are called live tiles. Another new GUI element is a vertical bar known as charms. Charms can be accessed by swiping in with your finger from the right edge of the screen, or by placing the mouse cursor in the upper-right corner of the screen. </p>
          <p></p>

          <p></p>
          <p>

            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Peek </b>- View the desktop icons that are behind open windows by placing your cursor over the Show desktop button found at the right edge of the taskbar. This makes the open windows transparent. Click the button to minimize all windows.</li>

          <p>In Windows 7 and Vista, users can place Gadgets on the desktop. Gadgets are small applications, such as games, sticky notes, a calendar or a clock. Figure 3 displays weather, calendar, and clock Gadgets on a Windows 7 desktop. You can snap or position gadgets to the sides and corners of the desktop, as well as align them to other gadgets.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Note</b>: Microsoft has retired support of the Gadgets feature.</p>
