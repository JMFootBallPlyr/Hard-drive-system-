        <h1>Install and Uninstall Applications</h1>
        <div>
          <p>As a technician, you will be responsible for adding and removing software from your customersâ€™ computers. Most applications use an automatic installation process when the application disc is inserted in the optical drive. The user is required to click through the installation wizard and provide information when requested.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Installing an Application</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Insert the CD or DVD into the optical drive, or open the downloaded program file. The program installer should start. If it does not start, run the setup or install file on the disc to begin installation, or download the program again.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>After the application is installed, you can run the application from the Start Menu or the shortcut icon that the application installs on the desktop. Check the application to ensure that it is functioning properly. If there are problems, repair or uninstall the application. Some applications, such as Microsoft Office, provide a repair option within the installation program. In addition to the process described above, Windows 8 provides access to the Windows Store, as shown in Figure 1. Windows Store allows a user to search and install apps on a Windows 8 computer (or other Windows 8 device). To open the Windows Store app:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>From the Start Screen, type <b>Store</b> and click the <b>Store</b> icon when it appears in the search results.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Uninstalling or Changing a Program</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>If an application is uninstalled incorrectly, you might be leaving files on the hard drive and unnecessary settings in the registry, which depletes the hard drive space and system resources. Unnecessary files might also reduce the speed at which the registry is read. Microsoft recommends that you always use the Programs and Features utility when removing, changing, or repairing applications. The utility guides you through the software removal process and removes every file that was installed.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Figure 2 shows Programs and Features in Windows 8.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Figure 3 shows Programs and Features in Windows 7 and Vista.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>In some instances, you can install or uninstall optional features of a program using the Programs and Features utility. Not all programs offer this option.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>To open the Programs and Features utility, use the following path:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Control Panel > Programs and Features</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>To uninstall or change a program:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 1</b>. Click <b>Control Panel > Programs and Features</b>.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 2</b>. Select a program, and then click <b>Uninstall</b>. To change a program, click <b>Change or Repair</b>. Administrator permission may be required. If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</p>
