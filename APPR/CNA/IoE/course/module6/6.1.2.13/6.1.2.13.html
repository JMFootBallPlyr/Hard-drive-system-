            <b>Device Manager</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Device Manager, shown in Figure 1, displays a list of all the devices installed in the computer, allowing you to diagnose and resolve device problems. You can view details about the installed hardware and drivers, as well as perform the following functions:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Update a driver</b> - Change the currently installed driver.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Roll back a driver</b> - Change the currently installed driver to the previously installed driver.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Uninstall a driver</b> - Remove a driver.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Disable a device</b> - Disable a device. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>To access the Device Manager, use the following path:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Control Panel > Device Manager</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>You can view the properties of any device in the system by double-clicking the device name.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The Device Manager utility uses icons to indicate a problem with a device, as shown in Figure 2.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Devices and Printers</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Use Devices and Printers for a high-level look at the devices connected to the computer. Devices displayed in Devices and Printers are typically external devices you can connect to your computer through a port or network connection. Devices and Printers also allow you to quickly add a new device to the computer. Windows will automatically install any necessary drivers.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Devices listed include:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Portable devices you carry with you and occasionally connect to your computer, such as mobile phones, portable music players, and digital cameras.</li>
            </ul>

            </ul>
          </p>

          <p>To access Devices and Printers in Windows 8 and 7, use the following path:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Control Panel > Devices and Printers</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>To install a new device, click the <b>Add a device</b> button.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Figure 3 shows the Devices and Printers tool in Windows 8.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>In Windows Vista, you can use <b>Add Hardware</b> to add new devices to your computer. To access <b>Add Hardware,</b> use the following path:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Control Panel > Add Hardware</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Sound</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Use the Sound utility to configure audio devices or change the sound scheme of the computer. For example, you can change the email notification sound from a beep to a chime. The Sound utility also allows a user to choose which audio device is to be used for playback or recording.</p>
