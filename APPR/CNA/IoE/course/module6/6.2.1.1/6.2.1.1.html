        <h1>Purpose of Virtual Machines</h1>
        <div>
          <p>In a business environment, companies must manage technological resources in a way that allows them to stay competitive by cutting costs and allocating resources wisely. As a result, client-side virtualization has become a popular method of providing staff with critical resources, such as applications, file-sharing services, and other productivity tools. Virtualization also has advantages for small office/home office (SOHO) users, because it can provide access to programs that are not available on a specific OS.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Virtualization means that the system resources of a computer are used to create a virtual machine. A virtual machine is a computer that exists within a computer. The physical computer is called a host, or host machine. The computer within the host is the virtual machine. The virtual machine is sometimes called a guest.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>A host machine must be a physical machine that is powered on and controlled by a user. A virtual machine uses the system resources on the host machine to boot and run an OS. The OS of the virtual machine is independent of the OS installed on the host machine. For example, a host machine running Windows 8.1 can host a virtual machine that has Windows 7 installed. This virtual machine can run software specific to Windows 7. The Windows 7 installation does not interfere with the Windows 8.1 installation on the host machine. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Host and guest operating systems do not need to be of the same family. For example, the host can be running Windows 7, while the guest runs Linux. If needed, users can further increase the functionality of their system resources by running multiple virtual machines.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The figure shows a logical virtual machine diagram. </p>
