        <h1>Hard Drive Backup</h1>
        <div>
          <p>It is important to establish a backup strategy that includes data recovery of personal files. You can use the Microsoft Backup Utility to perform backups as required. How the computer system is used, as well as organizational requirements, determines how often the data must be backed up and the type of backup to perform.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>It can take a long time to run a backup. If the backup strategy is followed carefully, it is not necessary to back up all files every time. Only the files that have changed since the last backup need to be backed up.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>In versions of earlier than Windows 8, you could use Backup and Restore to back up your files, or create and use a system image backup, or repair disc. Windows 8.1 ships with File History which can be used to back up the files in the Documents, Music, Pictures, Videos, and Desktop folders. Over time, File History builds a history of your files, allowing you to go back and recover specific versions of a file. This is a helpful feature if there are damaged or lost files. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>To get started with File History in Windows 8.1, shown in Figure 1, connect an internal or external drive, and then turn File History on by using the following path:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Control Panel > File History</b>
            <b>></b> click <b>Turn on</b></p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Windows 7 and Vista ship with a different backup tool called Backup and Restore, shown in Figure 2. When an external drive is selected, Windows 7 will offer the chance to use the new drive a backup device. Use Backup and Restore to manage backups.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>To access the Backup and Restore utility in Windows 7, use the following path:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Start > Control Panel > Backup and Restore</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>To access the Backup and Restore utility in Windows Vista, use the following path:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Start > All Programs > Accessories > System Tools > Backup Status and Configuration</b>
          </p>
