        <h1>Host Devices</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Computer networks consist of a variety of devices. Some devices can serve either as hosts or peripherals. A host is any device that sends and receives information on the network. A printer connected to your laptop is a peripheral. If the printer is connected directly to a network, it is acting as a host. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Many different types of host devices can connect to a network. Some of the more common ones are shown in Figure 1. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Note</b>: An Internet Protocol phone, which is known as an IP phone, connects to a computer network instead of the traditional telephone network.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Computer networks are used in businesses, homes, schools, and government agencies. Many networks are connected to each other through the Internet. A network can share many different types of resources, as shown in Figure 2.</p>
