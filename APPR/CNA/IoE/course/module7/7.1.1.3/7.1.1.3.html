        <h1>Intermediary Devices</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Computer networks contain many devices that exist in between the host devices. These intermediary devices ensure that data flows from one host device to another host device. The most common intermediary devices are shown in the figure. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>A switch is used to connect multiple devices to the network. A router is used to forward traffic between networks. A wireless router connects multiple wireless devices to the network. In addition, a wireless router often includes a switch so that multiple wired devices can connect to the network. An access point (AP) provides wireless connectivity, but has fewer features than a wireless router. A modem is used to connect a home or small office to the Internet. These devices will be discussed in more detail later in the chapter.</p>
