        <h1>Client-Server Networks</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Servers have software installed that enables them to provide services, such as files, email, or web pages, to clients. Each service requires separate server software. For example, the server in Figures 1 and 2 requires file server software to provide clients with the ability to retrieve and store files. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>In a client-server network, the client requests information or services from the server. The server provides the requested information or service to the client. Servers on a client-server network commonly perform some of the processing work for client machines. For example, a server can sort through a database before delivering the records requested by the client. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>A single server can run multiple types of server software. In a home or small business, it may be necessary for one computer to act as a file server, a web server, and an email server.  A client computer can also run multiple types of client software. There must be client software for every service required. With multiple client software installed, a client can connect to multiple servers at the same time. For example, a user can check email and view a web page while instant messaging and listening to Internet radio.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>In a client-server network, resources are controlled by a centralized network administration. The network administrator implements data backups and security measures. The network administrator also controls user access to the server resources.</p>
