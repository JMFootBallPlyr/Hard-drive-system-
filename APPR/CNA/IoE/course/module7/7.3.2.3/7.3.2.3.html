        <h1>Twisted-Pair Category Ratings</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Twisted-pair cables come in several categories (Cat). These categories are based on the number of wires in the cable and the number of twists in those wires. Most networks today are wired using twisted-pair cabling. The characteristics of twisted-pair cable are shown in Figure 1.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Note</b>: Cat 3 cables use a 6-pin RJ-11 connector, whereas all other twisted-pair cables use an 8-pin RJ-45 connector, as shown in Figure 2.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>New or renovated office buildings often have some type of UTP cabling that connects every office to a central point called the Main Distribution Facility (MDF). The distance limitation of UTP cabling used for data is 100 meters (330 feet). Cable runs in excess of this distance limitation need a switch, repeater, or hub to extend the connection to the MDF. These switches, repeaters, and hubs would be located in an IDF (Independent Distribution Facility).</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Cables that are installed inside plenum areas of buildings must be plenum rated. A plenum is any area that is used for ventilation, such as the area between the ceiling and a dropped ceiling. Plenum-rated cables are made from a special plastic that retards fire and produces less smoke than other cable types.</p>
