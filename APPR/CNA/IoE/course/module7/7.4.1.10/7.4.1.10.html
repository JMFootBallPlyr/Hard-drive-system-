        <h1>ICMP</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is used by devices on a network to send control and error messages to computers and servers. There are several different uses for ICMP, such as announcing network errors, announcing network congestion, and troubleshooting.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Ping is commonly used to test connections between computers. Ping is a simple but highly useful command-line utility used to determine whether a specific IP address is accessible. To see a list of options that you can use with the ping command, type <b>ping /?</b> in the Command Prompt window, as shown Figure 1.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Ping works by sending an ICMP echo request to a destination computer or other network device. The receiving device then sends back an ICMP echo reply message to confirm connectivity. Echo requests and echo replies are test messages that determine if devices can send packets to each other. With Windows, four ICMP echo requests (pings) are sent to the destination computer, as shown in Figure 2. If it is reachable, the destination computer responds with four ICMP echo replies. The percentage of successful replies can help you to determine the reliability and accessibility of the destination computer. Other ICMP messages report undelivered packets and whether a device is too busy to handle the packet. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>You can also use ping to find the IP address of a host when that hostâ€™s name is known. If you ping the name of a website, for example, cisco.com, as shown in Figure 2, the IP address of the server is displayed.</p>
