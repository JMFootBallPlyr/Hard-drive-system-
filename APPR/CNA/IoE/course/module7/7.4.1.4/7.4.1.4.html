        <h1>Classful and Classless IPv4 Addressing</h1>
        <div>
          <p>When IPv4 was first specified in 1981, addresses were divided into three classes, as shown in Figure 1. The value of the first octet in an IPv4 address indicates which class it belongs to. Each class was assigned a default subnet mask. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Subnet masks are often displayed using prefix notation, as shown in Figure 2. The number after the “slash” indicates how many bits in the subnet mask are one bits. For example, the Class B network 172.16.0.0 with subnet mask of 255.255.0.0 would be written as 172.16.0.0/16. The "/16" indicates that the first 16 bits in the subnet mask are all ones.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>In the early 1990s, it was clear to network engineers that the classful IPv4 addressing system would eventually run out of space. Many businesses were too large for a Class C network address, which only had 254 host addresses. But they were too small for a Class B network address with 65,534 host addresses. Therefore, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) came up with an address assignment strategy called Classless Inter-Domain Router (CIDR, pronounced as “cider”). CIDR was a temporary measure that allowed organizations to use addressing schemes customized to their particular situation. An organization could receive four Class C network addresses with a custom subnet mask, as shown in Figure 3. The resulting network address is called a supernet because it consists of more than one classful network address.</p>
