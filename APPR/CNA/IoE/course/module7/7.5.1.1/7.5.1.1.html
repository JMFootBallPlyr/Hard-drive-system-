          <p>Many different devices can connect to today's networks including computers, laptops, tablets, smartphones, TVs, watches, and  home appliances. These devices use a variety of media to connect to the network including copper, fiber, and wireless. Intermediary devices, such as switches and routers, ensure that data flows between source and destination. The type of networks these devices connect to include LANs, WLANs, PANs, MANs, and WANs. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Devices must agree on a set of rules before they can effectively communicate with each other. These rules are called standards and protocols. The OSI reference model and the TCP/IP protocol suite help network administrators and technicians understand the interaction of these various standards and protocols. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Ethernet standards come in wired and wireless varieties. The wired standard is IEEE 802.3 and the wireless standard is IEEE 802.11. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Data requires several different types of addresses and numbering to make sure it is received by the correct destination. MAC addresses are used by switches to forward traffic within a LAN. IP addresses are used by routers to determine the best path to a destination network. Port numbers are used by computers to determine which application should receive the data.</p>
