        <h1>Network Installation Completion List</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Computer technicians must be able to support the networking needs of their customers. Therefore you must be familiar with:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Network components</b> – Includes wired and wireless network interface cards (NIC) and network devices such as switches, wireless access points (APs), routers, multipurpose devices, and more.  </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Network design</b> – Involves knowing how networks are interconnected to support the needs of a business. For instance, the needs of a small business will differ greatly from the needs of a large business.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>Consider a small business with 10 employees. The business has contracted you to connect their users. As shown in the figure, a small multipurpose device could be used for such a small number of users. A multipurpose device provides router, switch, firewall, and access point capabilities. A multipurpose device is typically called a wireless router. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>If the business was much larger, then a wireless router would not be suitable. The organization would require dedicated switches, access points (AP), firewall appliances, and routers. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Regardless of network design, you must know how to install network cards, connect wired and wireless devices, and configure basic network equipment.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Note</b>: This chapter will focus on connecting and configuring a home or small office wireless router. The configurations will be demonstrated using Packet Tracer. However, the same functionality and similar graphical user interface (GUI) elements exist in all wireless routers. You can purchase a variety of low cost wireless routers online and from consumer electronic stores. There are a wide variety of manufacturers including Asus, Cisco, D-Link, Linksys, Netgear, and Trendnet.</p>
