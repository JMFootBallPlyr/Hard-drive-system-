        <h1>Basic Wireless Settings</h1>
        <div>
          <p>After establishing the connection to a router, it is good practice to configure some basic settings to help secure the wireless network: </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Network Mode</b> – Some wireless routers allow you to select which 802.11 standard to implement. Figure 1 shows that “Wireless-N Only” has been selected. This means that all wireless devices connecting the wireless router must have 802.11n NICs installed. Figure 2 describes the other network modes available in Packet Tracer. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Network Name (SSID)</b> – Assign a name or Service Set Identifier (SSID) to the wireless network. The wireless router announces its presence by sending broadcasts advertising its SSID. This allows wireless hosts to automatically discover the name of the wireless network. If the SSID broadcast is disabled, you must manually enter the SSID on wireless devices. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Channel</b> - Wireless devices communicate over specific frequency ranges. Interference can be caused by other nearby wireless routers, or home electronic devices, such as cordless phones and baby monitors, using the same frequency range. These devices can slow down the wireless performance and potentially break network connections. Setting the channel number is a way to avoid wireless interference. The 802.11b and 802.11g standards commonly use channels 1, 6, and 11 to avoid interference.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Wireless Security</b> - Most wireless routers support several different security modes. Currently, the strongest security mode is WPA2 with AES encryption, as shown in Figure 3. All the security modes that are available in Packet Tracer are described in the table in Figure 4.</p>
