        <h1>Domain and Workgroup</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Domain and workgroup are methods for organizing and managing computers on a network. They are defined as:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Domain</b> - A domain is a group of computers and electronic devices with a common set of rules and procedures administered as a unit. Computers in a domain can be located in different locations in the world. A specialized server called a domain controller manages all security-related aspects of users and network resources, centralizing security and administration. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Workgroup</b> - A workgroup is a collection of workstations and servers on a LAN that are designed to communicate and exchange data with one another. Each individual workstation controls its user accounts, security information, and access to data and resources. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>All computers on a network must be part of either a domain or a workgroup. When Windows is first installed on a computer, it is automatically assigned to a workgroup, as shown in the figure. </p>
