        <h1>Intrusion Detection and Prevention Services</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) passively monitor traffic on the network. Stand-alone IDS systems have largely disappeared in favor of Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPSs). But the detection feature of an IDS is still part of any IPS implementation. Figure 1 shows that an IDS-enabled device copies the traffic stream and analyzes the copied traffic rather than the actual forwarded packets. Working offline, it compares the captured traffic stream with known malicious signatures, similar to software that checks for viruses. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>An IPS builds upon IDS technology. However, an IPS device is implemented in inline mode. This means that all ingress (inbound) and egress (outbound) traffic must flow through it for processing. As shown in Figure 2, an IPS does not allow packets to enter the trusted side of the network without first being analyzed. It can detect and immediately address a network problem.</p>
