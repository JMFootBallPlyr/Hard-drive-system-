        <h1>External Features Unique to Laptops</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Laptop and desktop computers use many of the same hardware features so that peripherals can be interchangeable. The placement of ports, connections, and drives is unique because of the compact design of a laptop. Ports, connections, and drives are located on the exterior of the laptop, in the front, back, and side panels. USB ports allow external devices such as optical drives, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi to be attached to a laptop. Some laptops contain ExpressCard slots, Thunderbolt ports, and DisplayPorts as well.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Status indicators, ports, slots, connectors, bays, jacks, vents, and a keyhole are on the exterior of the laptop. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Figure 1 shows three LEDs on the top of the laptop. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Note:</b> LED displays vary among laptops. Consult the laptop manual for a list of specific status displays.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Figure 2 shows three components on the back of the laptop. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Laptops require a port for external power and can operate using either a battery or an AC power adapter. You can use this port to power the computer or to charge the battery. Laptop batteries are manufactured in various shapes and sizes. They use different types of chemicals and metals to store power. Figure 3 compares rechargeable batteries.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The left side of the laptop, shown in Figure 4, has 10 components.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>A security keyhole, shown in Figure 4, enables a user to connect a laptop to a stationary location, such as a desk, by using a combination or keyed cable lock.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The front of the laptop is shown in Figure 5. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The right side of the laptop is shown in Figure 6.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The bottom of the laptop is shown in Figure 7.</p>
