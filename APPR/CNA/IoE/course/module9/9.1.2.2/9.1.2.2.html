        <h1>Backlights and Inverters</h1>
        <div>
          <p>LCDs do not produce any light by themselves. A backlight shines through the screen and illuminates the display. Two common types of backlights are cold cathode fluorescent lamp (CCFL) and LED. With CCFL, fluorescent tubes are connected to an inverter, used to convert direct current (DC) to alternating current (AC). The florescent backlight, as shown in Figure 1, is behind the LCD screen. To replace the backlight, you must completely disassemble the display. The inverter, as shown in Figure 2, is behind the screen panel and close to the LCD. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>LED monitors use LED-based backlights, shown in Figure 3, and do not have fluorescent tubes or inverters. LED technology increases the longevity of the display because it consumes less power. Also, LED technology is safer for the environment because LEDs do not contain mercury. Mercury is a key ingredient in fluorescent backlights used in LCDs. </p>
