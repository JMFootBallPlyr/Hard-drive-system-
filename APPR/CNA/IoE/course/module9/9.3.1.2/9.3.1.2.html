          <p>An external flash drive is a removable storage device that connects to an expansion port such as USB, eSATA, or Firewire. External flash drives can be an SSD drive or a smaller device, such as the one shown in Figure 1. Flash drives provide fast access to data, high reliability, and reduced power usage. These drives are accessed by the operating system in the same way that other types of drives are accessed.</p>

            <b>Flash Cards and Flash Card Readers</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>A flash card is a data storage device that uses flash memory to store information. Flash cards are small, portable, and require no power to maintain data. They are commonly used in laptops, mobile devices, and digital cameras. A large variety of flash card models are available, and each varies in size and shape. Most modern laptops feature a flash card reader for Secure Digital (SD) and Secure Digital High Capacity (SDHC) flash cards, as shown in Figure 2. A flash card reader on a laptop is shown in Figure 3.</p>

            <b>Note:</b> Flash memory cards are hot-swappable and should be removed by following the standard procedure for hot-swappable device removal.</p>
