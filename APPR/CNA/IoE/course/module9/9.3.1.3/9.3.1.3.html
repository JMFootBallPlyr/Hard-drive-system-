        <h1>Smart Card Reader</h1>
        <div>
          <p>A smart card is similar to a credit card, but has an embedded microprocessor that can be loaded with data. It can be used for telephone calling, electronic cash payments, and other applications. The microprocessor on the smart card is there for security, and can hold much more information than that of a magnetic stripe found on a credit card.</p>
          <p>Smart cards have been around for more than a decade but were found mostly in Europe.  Recently, their popularity has increased in the United States.</p>
          <p>Smart card readers are used to read and write to smart cards and can be connected to a laptop using a USB port. There are two types of smart card readers:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Contact </b>- This type of reader requires a physical connection to the card, made by inserting the card into the reader, as shown in the figure.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Contactless </b>- This type of reader works on a radio frequency that communicates when the card comes close to the reader.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>Many smart card readers support contact and contactless read operations all in one device.</p>
